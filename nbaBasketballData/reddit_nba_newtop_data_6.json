The overall viewership of the NBA bubble was down a much much smaller amount, as in at most 27% for the first round, and even less for other games. And it's already been found that a large portion of that is because of the early day mid-week game times.\n\nSo unless your argument is that all these people who were sick of the politics in the NBA *only* decided to not watch the finals, then again, you are lying, and at very best deliberately misleading. The ratings of just 3 games are as low as your initial claim. The rest of the bubble is not even close to that. Not even close.\n\nSo when people claim the bubble was a success, they are not rwffering to just the first 3 games of the finals lol. They are referring to all of the other games in all the other rounds as well. The games that you apparently just ignored.\n\nAnd again, the NHL finals were down even more, at 61%.
