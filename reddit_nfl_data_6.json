  "selftext": "The young vs stroud thread from earlier today had quite a few discussions of Murray and Young mostly due to size. I didn\u2019t watch much CFB when Murray played but have seen a lot of Bryce in action. So I\u2019m wondering which one do you think was better in college and which one do you think will be better in NFL right now and long term.\n\nMurray was named OROY and made 2 pro bowls in his first 3 seasons. He\u2019s listed at 5\u201910\u201d 207lbs and arguably led the MVP race for the first half of the 2021 season.\n\nYoung is listed at 6\u20190\u201d and 194lbs  but I think he will also be 5\u201910\u201d when measured in the upcoming months. He\u2019s widely considered the best QB in the class despite the size concerns.\n\nSo yeah just quite curious to read discussion as to how the community thinks/thought of them as prospects and players.",

      "body": "Very different players in my opinion\n\nKyler: Hyper accurate, elite athleticism (especially acceleration), short but somewhat thickly built, not adept at navigating the pocket at all (tended to take a very deep drop in order to see), pretty solid seeing the field but nothing special, slightly above average arm strength. Likes to play within structure or scramble if it's not there.\n\nYoung: Elite field vision and pocket navigation (always knows where to find a window, always moving under control), very good accuracy/ball placement with probably average NFL arm strength. Slightly built, good athlete but not twitched up or super fast. Puts the ball where it needs to go on time, and makes some ridiculous plays when things break down.\n\nOnly real thing I'd say they have in common is that they're both short.",

      "body": "The height isn\u2019t as much of a concern, but his frame. He is very skinny. Murray has a much thicker, sturdier build, Young is very wiry and skinny. And Murray has elite, elite arm-talent. Like top-5 in the league and runs a 4.4. Murray\u2019s sturdy, stronger build and combination of truly elite athleticism/arm talent is why teams were ok with a shorter quarterback. Young is probably further along fundamentally and intellectually than Murray ways, but does not have the frame and physical tools Murray foes, Young has a good, not great arm. And Young can make some things happen with his legs, but he\u2019s not gonna break tackles, juke out defenders, or break off long runs like Murray. And I really like Young\u2019s game, but the size concerns are very legit and probably only has maybe above-average arm/athleticism.",

The inverse of that (great traits but subpar intangibles) we see bust all the time.\n\nI know Young is quite an outlier in a lot of ways, but one of the reasons I'm so high on him is because I feel like players with that elite mental aspect of their game don't bust very often. I'd love to hear of any examples that I may be overlooking.",

He lacks the passing skills Young has when coming out and you could even argue now.\n\nBoth have concerns about their frame. To me the height is a bit overrated because they have played their entire careers with people taller in front of them so they have learned how to adapt. Murray has been good about avoiding contact when getting sacked or when running so hopefully Young learns the same traits."

Levis has better prototypical size and great arm strength, but on tape, there is virtually nothing I don't think Stroud does far better; I also think Stroud's arm strength criticisms are a bit exaggerated. I get Levis > Richardson, but not Levis > Stroud. The Kentucky pro-style argument is also flawed with Levis because he's struggled with consistency, vision and took bad sacks under that scheme. In my heart, I prefer Richardson > Levis on what they could be, but Richardson probably needs to go the perfect scenario to properly develop, and I can rationally understand Levis as having a higher floor whilst still having a lot of talent.",

CJ strouds game against Georgia to me just locked in he's a top 5 talent at QB.  Didn't change that Young is still QB1.\n\n- Assuming after the combine Bryce Young is 5'11 and 200 pounds, Bryce Young.  \n\n\nIn today's NFL him being 5'11 and 200 pounds (which I think will be his NFL playing weight), isnt a big changer for me because he's a special player.  I get the concept that \"he won't be able to withstand the hits in the NFL\", but I don't think there's a big difference between him or stroud when every NFL dlineman  is  a 6''5 300+ most elite type of athlete humanity has ever produced type of human being.  When it's that type of player coming after you every game give me the pro ready qb who's dominated at the highest level in college and is one of the better ones at avoiding getting the rush.",

        "I\u2019m glad you got in depth on that. Thanks for the perspective on it.",
        "I think Bryce Young has been an outstanding player and I don't want to discredit his production and ability. I'm just very hesitant about a guy his listed size holding up long term in the NFL.\n\nA lot of this depends on his combine measurements, but he's listed as 194 lbs by Alabama. That's one of the lightest QB weights in the past 30 years if it's true. That's Koy Detmer and Kellen Moore type of size. He can be successful at a small frame, but he would be an outlier.\n\nIf I'm an NFL GM with a gun to my head picking a 195 lb Young or CJ Stroud I would pick Stroud. Maybe Stroud is a lesser passer right now, but I'm not cringing every time my QB gets leveled by a DT. The extra 20 lbs of muscle helps absorb hits a lot.",
        "I\u2019ve seen the reports that he\u2019s looking to bulk up to 200, but his size absolutely has to be a legit concern. I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he\u2019s actually around 175 in college, so I just wonder what adding 25 pounds will do to his mobility. His frame is just tiny, he makes Kyler look like a muscle hamster by comparison. \n\nThere\u2019s a lot to like about Bryce, but I think people are underrating Stroud. People seemed to have been pleasantly surprised by the UGA game, but it backed up what I have seen from him. My take is CJ is more pro ready right now, and more refined mechanically. \n\nI think Young could be better on a worse team with his ability to create big plays out of structure, but if CJ goes to a team with a strong OL, I think he\u2019ll be very good immediately. He slides in the pocket like a pro already. With that said, Stroud going to a really bad team with a bad OL could be disastrous for his career.",
        "There\u2019s a picture of Young standing next to Drew Brees where it\u2019s pretty clear he\u2019s\u2026 at best 5\u201910\u201d\n\nThese shorter, thin elite QBs are struggling to stay on the field.\n\nTo me, he\u2019s a guy I\u2019d want around pick 10. Love the player,  but the risk is insane. He\u2019s not a Kyler Murray sort of freak athlete. If he\u2019s hidden behind a tremendous OL, he could have some nice years, but on a rebuilding team? Good luck.",
        "I think you\u2019re understating his size here. Bryce is an absolute baller, incredible player, but with 6\u20195 300lb guys coming at you some guys are going to be able to withstand it better than others. He\u2019s definitely not 5\u201911. There is no historical precedent for a successful QB of Bryce\u2019s size.",
        "Will this change for you if Bryce comes in at 5\u20199\u201d 195 instead",
        "My concern is that his current height and weight are being inflated by Alabama. I know a lot of schools do this with their players, but I don't actually know if Bama has a history of doing that.\n\nBut imagine they do, and he's closer to 5'9\" 170 at the combine. That might change things.",
        "I don't think Bryce Young is going to be close to 5'11 200",
        "As a QB Bryce is special and as an athlete he\u2019s good. Kyler as a QB was good (with presumed room to grow) and as an athlete he\u2019s special. So even if Bryce is a hair under 200 I\u2019ll take that over being 5\u20199 because you can add weight, you can\u2019t add height.",
        "I'm obviously no expert on the matter, but I've always wondered if it's actually true that smaller guys aren't as durable.  I mean, what is it about being short, or weighing less that makes it so you can't take hits?  I get that you won't have the mass and might get tackled easier, but a tackle is a tackle I would think.  Is this just one of those things that everyone just \"knows\" to be true and nobody really questions it?  I'd actually love to see a breakdown of games missed due to injury by size.  It would be interesting.",

Draft experts seem pretty split on them and it seems like the biggest factor is Young\u2019s size. He looks close to Kyler, height wise, in their commercial when they stand next to each other and Kyler is in shoes while Bryce is in slides. So he\u2019ll probably measure in at 5\u201910, Kyler measured in at 5\u201910 1/8 at the combine. Can a short QB be successful? Sure, we\u2019ve seen it with Brees, Wilson, and Kyler. Doesn\u2019t happen often, but it happens. But have we seen a slim QB be successful over a long period of time? Closest I think is Kyler at 207, and he\u2019s missed multiple games due to injury because being that small and taking all those hits from players that have 40-100 pounds on him adds up. I hope that Bryce can put on a decent amount of weight and have it stick, but I dunno if his frame supports that. I think Stroud is safer, but Young has a higher ceiling",

        "It really wasn\u2019t just one game for CJ though \n\nCJ in 2021 ranged from good to elite (Michigan game) out of structure. His PFF grade under pressure came in at 15th in the NCAA. His 2021 tape is littered with him creating out of structure. Is he more hesitant to actually run the football than maybe you\u2019d like? Sure, 100% But there\u2019s tape all over of him winning outside the pocket and anybody saying it only showed for the first time in UGA didn\u2019t use any of Stroud\u2019s 2021 tape to evaluate him - which I sorta get, you want to use the most recent year.\n\nWhat happened in 2022? Probably a multitude of things. The interior OL at OSU struggled in pass pro this year, so a lot of his pressure came up the middle which is notoriously much more difficult to navigate as a QB and still an area of concern for CJ. Maybe a little protecting his draft stock too? Idk, but teams will want to get to the root of the differences under pressure year over year for sure\n\nThat said, Bryce is still my QB1 and I think that if he was 6\u20192\u201d 210 he\u2019d be talked about in the Luck/Lawrence tier of QB prospects.

He's small, and you can clearly see that on the field. He's athletic but he's not really a scrambler, and he's less of a rusher than some of the other successful short QBs (Wilson, Kyler, Baker). If Young is playing at 190 or less than he would be one of the lightest starting QBs of the modern era and you probably wouldn't want him to take a hit ever.\n\nStroud has really grown on me. He has a great arm and great decision making. He isn't super athletic but I don't know that he needs to be. To contrast him with Fields, he came in right after Fields with the same weapons and he demolished Fields in nearly every passing metric. PFF has Stroud rated much higher as a passer. I wouldn't be surprised if Stroud is the first QB off the board, especially if Young weighs in light.\n\nBoth of these guys have NFL arms and have had solid college careers, and both are miles and miles ahead of Will Levis.\n\nEdit: Young is currently listed as 6'0 194 on the Bama site, and they exaggerate everyone a bit, so if that's exaggerated my guess is 5'10-11, 185"

I do think Stroud and Young are a smidge better than last class but Levis absolutely should not be getting the projections that he is. That said I wouldn\u2019t take any this year before like pick 20. Viewing them on the same plane as other players instead of putting them on the QB pedestal is what teams did last year and I hope that continues",

Maybe nothing in there is overly exceptional besides his pocket presence, but you also can't have legitimate gripes about anything he does. Young is a heisman winning QB who plays in a really flashy way so of course he's also getting a lot of love and attention. It's after that where we just have literally nothing, so instead we're going to pretend that Anthony Richardson has great pocket presence instead of just being a QB who would have been a 5 star TE if he played that position who is always looking to run (who will literally have to relearn how to throw a football) and that Will Levis will become an elite NFL QB because he \"looks\" like an NFL QB despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\nPersonally, I think this is more the new normal. We had a pretty long stretch where every single year college passing records were getting broken and there were several legitimately amazing QBs, and that was just unsustainable. These kind of things tend to naturally ebb and flow for whatever reason, and all these people who would be great QBs are either literally not being born or doing things other than football."

Young is a heisman winning QB who plays in a really flashy way so of course he's also getting a lot of love and attention. It's after that where we just have literally nothing, so instead we're going to pretend that Anthony Richardson has great pocket presence instead of just being a QB who would have been a 5 star TE if he played that position who is always looking to run (who will literally have to relearn how to throw a football) and that Will Levis will become an elite NFL QB because he \"looks\" like an NFL QB despite all the evidence to the contrary.\n\nPersonally, I think this is more the new normal. We had a pretty long stretch where every single year college passing records were getting broken and there were several legitimately amazing QBs, and that was just unsustainable.

Wilson did work out, but as we're seeing now, that's in large part because of his mobility.

You either have it or you don't. \n\nThe best quarterbacks are the ones that dissect from inside the pocket and create from outside. Lots of guys are strong inside the pocket and weaker outside, but that can still lead to a productive NFL career.",

Do you know how many players, first round picks, add 10%+ in weight once they join the NFL. It happens all the time at almost every position.  He knew he was going to be a top NFL draft prospect because he played at an elite level.  He's very aware he needs to add size for the NFL.  This is common at basically every position.

      "body": "Just checked Clowney actually had 13 sacks his sophomore year and 3 sacks his junior year. I just remember the main talking point being with him that he was a freak athlete but was not a complete pass rusher. He was the consensus top pick mostly because it was a week QB class. I remember a week before the draft that there are legitimate talks about Khalil Mack going first overall because he also had a great combine.\n\nYou are right about him not being elevated to 1.01 but he was still questioned in regards to his pass rush skill. I think this negative narrative was more because in recent history, (Clowney) taking an edge rusher at 1 hasn't worked out.\n\nI agree of the examples these guys are not the best evidence but I always just remember the selling point being \"if they figure it out the league is in trouble\" which is the same thing being said about all athletic rushers."

Just taking a stab at how it looks like things may be unfolding from a 10,000 foot perspective.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/38vuki6ddfea1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=46f1383973ae682b7b7268e2f76b57ac90fb7a5e\n\n**Arizona Cardinals:** The Cardinals have a second interview set up with Cowboys defensive coordinator **Dan Quinn** and I feel like his leadership and defensive acumen could be a very sharp contrast to Kliff Kingsbury. We'll say he keeps defensive coordinator Vance Joseph in town, and then Cowboys assistant Brian Schottenheimer as the offensive coordinator. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/i6fxdibedfea1.png?width=3800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=90871f1b77ff3bf76cd1726e48921687fa8c003a\n\n**Carolina Panthers:** With Ben Johnson returning to Detroit, I think this one ends up being former Colts head coach **Frank Reich** getting a second opportunity to run things, especially after reports indicate Steichen's interview didn't seal the deal. Reich gives it another try, with Steve Wilks staying on as defensive coordinator, and Eagles passing game coordinator Kevin Patullo as offensive coordinator. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/t1l06ywfdfea1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=6220d6463a65bdd362c4b4c73ec385567dc2c9dc\n\n**Denver Broncos:** Right now there's a lot of buzz on two candidates: Dan Quinn and DeMeco Ryans. But at the moment, Denver doesn't really have anything else publicly set up with Quinn, so we're going with 49ers defensive coordinator **DeMeco Ryans** as the new head coach. He brings veteran offensive mind Anthony Lynn with him from San Francisco, and hires former Browns defensive coordinator Joe Woods to the same role. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/0o3rx6ihdfea1.png?width=900&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=ce495ea5e3526067136be3ac3d12168825437e9d\n\n**Houston Texans:** With Ryans off to Denver, the Texans should make a play for a different defensive coordinator, Eagles' **Jonathan Gannon**, bringing Eagles QB coach Brian Johnson along as offensive coordinator and former Vikings head coach Mike Zimmer as defensive coordinator. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/xw04y5tidfea1.png?width=660&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=84beb489b29c415606a020f1f963290b968da997\n\n**Indianapolis Colts:** Probably the toughest one to peg right now, I think the Colts go with Rams defensive coordinator **Raheem Morris**, a high-energy, well liked defensive mind. He brings along Rams defensive line coach Eric Henderson as defensive coordinator, and veteran offensive mind Greg Olson (LAR) as offensive coordinator. \n\n**Coordinator Hires:**\n\n* Minnesota Vikings DC: Seahawks defensive backs coach **Sean Desai.**\n* Los Angeles Rams OC: Former Jets offensive coordinator **Mike LaFleur**.\n* Baltimore Ravens OC: Rams quarterbacks coach **Zac Robinson.** \n* New York Jets OC: Former Denver Broncos head coach **Nathaniel Hackett**. -- Update: This one actually came [to fruition.](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/35531136/jets-hire-former-broncos-coach-nathaniel-hackett-new-oc) Unfortunately that means all these picks will be right, so if you hate the coach I gave you, sorry!\n* Tampa Bay Buccaneers OC: Georgia offensive coordinator **Todd Monken**. \n* Los Angeles Chargers OC: Rams tight ends coach **Thomas Brown**. \n* Tennessee Titans OC: Falcons quarterbacks coach **Charles London**. \n* Washington Commanders OC: Commanders quarterbacks coach **Kevin Zampese**. \n* Atlanta Falcons DC: Saints defensive line coach **Ryan Nielsen**. \n* Miami Dolphins DC: Saints defensive backs coach **Kris Richard**. \n* Philadelphia Eagles DC: Eagles defensive backs coach **Dennard Wilson**. \n* Los Angeles Rams DC: Former Broncos head coach **Vic Fangio**. \n* Dallas Cowboys DC: Cowboys secondary coach **Joe Whitt Jr.**\n\n# FIRST ROUND\n\n**TRADE!** Using the details of the most recent [mock draft from The 33rd Team,](https://www.the33rdteam.com/category/analysis/2023-nfl-mock-draft-2-2-colts-trade-up-for-no-1-pick-will-levis/) which has the **Indianapolis Colts** sending first-, second-, and third-round picks this year, along with a first-round pick in 2024, to the **Chicago Bears** for their selection here, and a fourth-rounder this year. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dqyzmrakdfea1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=b655be93475102e3e4c2c33c97ffe198ed1475c8\n\n**(1.) Indianapolis Colts (via CHI) - QB Bryce Young, Alabama** // I still would put my bet on Young as the top QB from this class. He's proven, he's very dynamic, and he's very polished as well. The size concerns are a legitimate concern to monitor, but until the rumor mill starts pushing someone else out for #1 overall, I like Young's ability to become a franchise QB for a team that needs one here. \n\n**(2.) Houston Texans - QB C.J. Stroud, Ohio State** // With Davis Mills failing to take a step forward after a decent rookie year, the Texans are likely in the QB market, and Stroud's a very polished and accurate passer who has put up some big numbers over his two seasons starting in Columbus. He flashed how dynamic he can be in the playoff loss to Georgia. \n\n**(3.) Arizona Cardinals - EDGE Will Anderson Jr., Alabama** // Arizona could be in a spot to try and trade down, but instead, grabbing an elite pass rusher to rebuild a mediocre defense should be the aim. After seeing how well Dan Quinn was able to deploy Micah Parsons in Dallas, it's easy to envision him doing similarly with Anderson here in Arizona. \n\n**(4.) Chicago Bears (via IND) - DT Jalen Carter, Georgia** // The best case scenario here for Chicago, where they land a blue chip defensive tackle to rebuild a mediocre defensive line while still adding additional picks. Carter is explosive and violent at the point of attack, even if he didn't light up the stat sheet the way some would expect. \n\n**(5.) Seattle Seahawks (via DEN) - QB Will Levis, Kentucky** // Geno Smith almost certainly will be back, but personally, I think Levis has terrific upside, and Smith still has just the one season of production and will be 33-years old this upcoming season. In short, not a long-term solution in Smith, so taking advantage of his steady play to serve as a bridge to Levis seems appealing. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bft6kvipdfea1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=c87bca288479a7c5484c7c798f4238f1acabe575\n\n**(6.) Detroit Lions - CB Devon Witherspoon, Illinois** // Witherspoon fits the Lions defensive scheme quite nicely, with excellent ability in man coverage, and a terrific physicality against the run. It's easy to envision Dan Campbell and Aaron Glenn falling in love with the star of the Illini defense this offseason. \n\n**(7.) Las Vegas Raiders - DT Bryan Bresee, Clemson** // The Raiders could go with a few different options here, but they desperately need to rework their defensive line. Bresee is still quite raw, really only showing his dominance in flashes, but he has all the tools to become an elite interior lineman for defensive coordinator Patrick Graham. \n\n**(8.) Atlanta Falcons - EDGE Tyree Wilson, Texas Tech** // This next little crop of players are all a bit less proven, but still possess very high upside, and Wilson is certainly amongst them. A very long frame at 6'6, 275 lbs., he can be deployed in versatile fashion by new Falcons defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen, a defensive line coach by trade who can work some magic with Wilson. \n\n**(9.) Carolina Panthers - EDGE Myles Murphy, Clemson** // A local product just next door, Murphy too possess elite upside as a well built, explosive pass rusher. He's also just 21-years old and still developing. Carolina really needs a QB, but unless they're in love with Anthony Richardson, pursuing another veteran, such as Aaron Rodgers or Derek Carr could be a more valuable play. \n\n**(10.) Philadelphia Eagles (via NO) - CB Joey Porter Jr., Penn State** // Man, forcing Steelers fans to watch the in-state star of a former Steelers Pro Bowler would be fun in and of itself. But that's even before you begin to weight the very high upside that Porter Jr., and his freaky long arms bring to the table as a coverage guy on the outside. \n\n**(11.) Tennessee Titans - OT Paris Johnson Jr., Ohio State** // Taylor Lewan's future in Tennessee seems tenuous at best, and now Mike Vrabel gets the opportunity to replace the former Michigan star with one from his own alma mater instead. Johnson's an athletic marvel at the tackle position, and really acquitted himself nicely in Columbus this past season. \n\n**TRADE!** The **Pittsburgh Steelers** move up, sending a 2023 first-round pick, a 2023 third-round pick, and a 2024 third-round pick to the **Houston Texans** here. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jnet4dhrdfea1.png?width=2560&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=01a612e100b3f32d712d4812cd1c487c337d519b\n\n**(12.) Pittsburgh Steelers (via HOU/CLE) - OT Broderick Jones, Georgia** // The Steelers hope in front of the tackle needy Jets to grab their choice of pass protector. Jones was sensational for the Bulldogs this past season, helping pave the way for a very efficient offense en route to a national title. While he's a bit shorter of build, he still has the arm length and athleticism to lock down a tackle spot for the Steelers. \n\n**(13.) New York Jets - OL Peter Skoronski, Northwestern** // The Jets, now offensively led by Nathaniel Hackett, will aim to atone for arguably the only two significant mistakes Douglas has made so far: drafting both QB Zach Wilson and OT Mekhi Becton as highly as he did. Skoronski was a terrific left tackle for the Wildcats, and probably starts out there in New York, but could play any number of positions, which is helpful, given Laken Tomlinson's disappointing play and the significant injury bug that decimated the Jets OL. \n\n**(14.) New England Patriots - WR Quentin Johnston, TCU** // New England's offense needs to become more dynamic if they hope to make things work with QB Mac Jones. Adding a big, speedy playmaker in Johnston sure could help them in that arena, as he would fit quite nicely along a hopefully re-signed Jakobi Myers in Bill O'Brien's new passing attack. \n\n**(15.) Green Bay Packers - EDGE Lukas Van Ness, Iowa** // Not my own idea, but one that's started popping up, and it makes a lot of sense given how Green Bay operates, opting to consistently refill their pass rushing ranks with athletic players like Van Ness that they can slowly bring along. They did a very nice job with Rashan Gary, and now pair him with Van Ness, who can also kick inside to make room for Preston Smith as well. \n\n**(16.) Washington Commanders - QB Anthony Richardson, Florida** // A cornerback could certainly come into play here, but the Commanders need a QB, and I ultimately do think someone takes Richardson early, believing in their ability to develop his crazy arm talent and athleticism into an NFL quarterback. If that's Ron Rivera and the Commanders, I'm honestly not sure, but that's what we're going with here, for now. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s8984fktdfea1.png?width=1400&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=0fa00468cf1880354d799b9920f3c515a48475b2\n\n**(17.) Houston Texans (via PIT) - DL Keion White, Georgia Tech** // The former Old Dominion transfer is getting a lot of buzz right now, and after putting together 8.5 sacks at Georgia Tech last season, I ultimately think White's going to shoot up boards. He can rush the QB, and from a number of different alignments, allowing the Texans and new defensive coordinator Mike Zimmer to get creative with him. \n\n**(18.) Detroit Lions - S/CB Brian Branch, Alabama** // Brad Holmes has shown he'll double up on a similar position if the players in question can be used together, and with Branch's versatility as a nickel cornerback or even safety, he fits very nicely in the Lions defense, which would allow him to roam the defense freely to make plays. \n\n**TRADE!** The **Jacksonville Jaguars** send a 2023 first-round pick, a 2023 third-round pick, and a 2024 fourth-round pick to the **Tampa Bay Buccaneers**. \n\n**(19.) Jacksonville Jaguars (via TB) - CB Christian Gonzalez, Oregon** // The former Colorado transfer was a stud for the Ducks defense this season, and with the length that Trent Baalke seems to love at the cornerback position, Jacksonville makes an aggressive move for an impact defender who can fill a major need on their defense as they attempt to defend the AFC South crown in 2023. \n\n**(20.) Seattle Seahawks - DL Tuli Tuipulotu, USC** // Pete Carroll snags a dynamic interior pass rusher from his former college employer after Tuipulotu put together a very impressive season for the Trojans this fall, tallying 13.5 sacks. His versatility between the edge and interior should help him fit nicely with a solid group of edge players like Darrell Taylor and Uchenna Nwosu. \n\n**(21.) Miami Dolphins - Pick Forfeited due to Tampering.**\n\n**(22.) Los Angeles Chargers - WR Jordan Addison, USC** // The former Blietnekoff winner remains out in Los Angeles with the Chargers opting to add him here in the late first. With Keenan Allen and Mike Williams battling injuries, and rising cap hits, the Chargers may want to get a bit younger on offense, and adding Addison could be a huge boost for QB Justin Herbert. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/pmabfp4vdfea1.png?width=2479&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=df48e461de5e202a3e714d1bfbc3120aed75e3b2\n\n**(23.) Baltimore Ravens - WR Zay Flowers, Boston College** // With a lackluster free agent market at the WR position, the Ravens may want to use their free agency resources elsewhere, and instead look to the draft for a dynamic pass catcher to help Lamar Jackson and the Ravens offense take the next step under new offensive coordinator Zac Robinson. Flowers is smaller in build, but extremely dangerous as a playmaker. \n\n**TRADE!** The **Cincinnati Bengals** strike a deal with the **Minnesota Vikings,** sending a 2023 first-round pick, a 2023 third-round pick, and a 2024 third-round pick to the Vikings for their selection here. \n\n**(24.) Cincinnati Bengals (via MIN) - TE Michael Mayer, Notre Dame** // Cincinnati could opt to re-sign Hayden Hurst after a solid season, but they've struggled in the redzone throughout this season, and thus, making an aggressive move for a stud tight end like Mayer could be another very strong move to keep adding weapons around one of the NFL's most lethal QB's in Joe Burrow. \n\n**(25.) Tampa Bay Buccaneers (via JAC) - CB Kelee Ringo, Georgia** // With a trio of defensive backs set to hit free agency (Sean Bunting, Jamel Dean, and Logan Ryan), Todd Bowles could be looking to restock the secondary. Ringo's had his ups and downs throughout his career, but has immense physical gifts to be developed into a top tier starting cornerback. \n\n**TRADE!** The **New York Giants** trade a 2023 first-round pick and a 2023 fifth-round pick to the **Arizona Cardinals** for WR DeAndre Hopkins and a 2023 third-round pick in return. \n\n**(26.) Arizona Cardinals (via NYG) - G O'Cyrus Torrence, Florida** // The Cardinals are likely looking to deal WR DeAndre Hopkins, and while *Sports Illustrated's* Albert Breer suggested a trade may not be as easy as hoped, the dearth of a WR free agent market could play to their hands. They get a first-rounder (albeit having to lessen a third-round pick in exchange as well), and use it to rebuild their offensive line. \n\n**(27.) Dallas Cowboys - RB Bijan Robinson, Texas** // With Tony Pollard set to hit the market and Ezekiel Elliott a potential cap cut, the Cowboys could simply wipe the slate clean at running back and start anew with the most dynamic back we've seen in the Draft since Saquon Barkely. I'd genuinely be surprised if he slipped down to 27th, but it's always a bit shaky with running backs these days. \n\n**(28.) Buffalo Bills - LB Trenton Simpson, Clemson** // This one is only a realistic move if the Bills let Tremaine Edmunds walk in free agency. They'd replace him with a very well-rounded modern linebacker who can do a bit of everything. Simpson's speed, coverage ability, capacity as a blitzer, and instincts in the box make him an awesome fit next to Matt Milano. \n\n**(29.) Minnesota Vikings (via CIN) - CB Cam Smith, South Carolina** // The Vikings defensive rebuild gets under way with a new defensive coordinator in Sean Desai, and a shiny new defensive back for the former DB coach to work with. Smith has all the tools you'd want in a first-round cornerback, and should be able to make a quick impact in Minneapolis. \n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/cdtt4mvwdfea1.png?width=1929&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=2447fb1a8372f2d73f2cd0ee58a81089dc5e3ae2\n\n**(30.) Denver Broncos (via SF) - OT Dawand Jones, Ohio State** // A massive mountain of a human being at 6'8, 360 lbs. Jones is physical at the point of attack, and possess excellent length to keep pass rushers at bay. Regardless of the new Broncos head coach, finding some reinforcements to a deteriorating offensive line will be a key priority for GM George Paton. \n\n**(31.) Kansas City Chiefs - WR Jaxon Smith-Njigba, Ohio State** // A true X-WR might fit a tad bit cleaner, but if there's anything we know of Andy Reid and Eric Bieniemy, it's that they'll make it work on offense. Smith-Njigba is a dynamic route runner, with elite separation and craftiness to set up his breaks. He'd be a terror alongside Juju Smith-Schuster and Mecole Hardman. \n\n**(32.) Philadelphia Eagles - EDGE Felix Anundike-Uzomah, Kansas State** // I am probably higher on FAU than most, as he's my final first-round grade here. He's an explosive pass rusher that the Eagles would look to develop into yet another highly successful pass rusher. He was a big piece of the Wildcats Big 12 championship this season.",

Witherspoon + Simpson. Witherspoon + Bijan, Gonzalez + Branch. \n\nObviously dependent on overall value and how the board falls but whoever is Holmes\u2019 guy in Brad we trust.

If they\u2019re going to make a trade, it\u2019ll be for a younger WR, and even then, Schoen has made it clear \u201cthe team isn\u2019t a WR away\u201d (he said this in relation to why he didn\u2019t trade for one at this last deadline)\n\nIf anything, it\u2019s more likely the giants trade back if the board falls like this and the top WRs are already off the board.

Sorry about that.\n\nI\u2019m kidding\u2026 sorta\n\nPete was taking specifically about their dominant DL built with high draft picks.\n\nI understand that you want there to be a feeding frenzy for the Bears top pick and the Hawks have the most attractive collection of picks. Even if they didnt get the pick, their mere participation would drive the perceived  price up. \n\nBut me agreeing with won\u2019t influence Pete or John at all. No one who follows those two closely thinks they\u2019ll draft a QB. \n\nEven if we lose Geno, I still don\u2019t think we go QB early. Here is my reasoning, remember how mud sh%t they got last year for not adding a QB? But they stuck to their guns and let those guys compete for the job. And Seahawks fans will tell you that Pete talked like he thought Lock might win the job. Then he got covid and Geno kept on chugging. \n\nSo now that their approach from last year was vindicated and they saw clearly that their DL is a mess and they best team in our division dominated with an offense like ours and a dominant DL, I don\u2019t see any way that we don\u2019t go 75% to 100% front seven with our first four picks. Maybe JBN at 20.\n\nI could even see them trading up to get in front of NE and GB to grab Lukas Van Ness before one of those teams does. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t worry too much. I think a lot of teams are going to see Bryce Young as an elite NFL QB and gonna want to get that Bears pick at nearly any cost. Texans, Raiders, Colts and Panthers are gonna be horny af. We will probably play into the QB hype a bit too so that no team tries to jump us if Jalen Carter or Will Anderson falls for some crazy reason.",

  "selftext": "With the Senior Bowl less than one week away, I thought I'd start looking at the position groups and list who I'm most excited to see. Today, we look at the EDGE group\n\n1. **Isaiah Land, FAMU**\n\nLand is in the conversation for the best HBCU prospect coming into the draft this year, 19 sacks in 2021. 4.6 40, 10'9\" broad jump, and a 6.7 three cone drill. Here's the kicker, he's 6'4\" about 215 pounds, he's long and lanky. Definitely a project for some team, probably a day three pick. I just want to see him against top competition and see how he looks. Does he look comfortable? Does he look overwhelmed? How does he handle losing a rep?\n\n2. **Keion White, Georgia Tech** \n\nDefinitely a name you've probably heard by now, I think White can seriously put himself into first round conversation by the end of the week. Huge guy at 6'4\" 290 pounds with the versatility to play as a stand up OLB down to a 3 tech. Still relatively new to the position, was recruited as a TE. A dominant week would be huge for him\n\n3. **Adetomiwa Adebawore, Northwestern**\n\nAdebawore doesn't get the respect I think he deserves, I've loved him all year, watch his OSU tape and you will too. I really don't know if he's an EDGE, but he is crazy disruptive. 6'1\" 280, compact build with good length and a crazy fast first step\n\n4. **KJ Henry, Clemson**\n\nPhysicality. That's what I expect KJ Henry to bring to Mobile. Unlike his teammate Myles Murphy, I wouldn't call him a freak athlete, but he's such a physical player. He sets a mean edge and deconstructs blocks with a ruthless motor. He has a little ways to go as a pass rusher, but he has the traits to be a good one. His mentality and motor should set him apart in Mobile\n\n5. **Derick Hall, Auburn**\n\nHall was one of the first players I remember watching in this draft cycle, and I was instantly intrigued. Insane combination of explosiveness, raw power and length. One particular play I remember he hit an OT with a stab and put the guy on his ass. Nothing more than just a ordinary stab. He doesn't play under control all the time, but those traits could help him stand out in Mobile\n\n6. **Andre Carter II, Army**\n\nAndre Carter is a name that doesn't need introduction, we all know the 6'7\" monster from Army. Here's what I'm looking for, \"How does he do against better competition than he's used to?\", \"How does he look against the run?\"\n\n7. **Will McDonald IV, Iowa State**\n\nAll I want to see with Will McDonald is what I hear everyone else raving about him, I don't see it on tape. A lot of that is Iowa State rushing from a three point stance head up on the tackle or shaded outside. I'd like to see him wider, 7-9 tech, and see if those traits I hear about flash\n\n8. **Zach Harrison, Ohio State**\n\nWe all know Zach Harrison is a freakishly long and explosive athlete, he has all the traits. Why was his college career so underwhelming? What was with the inconsistency I saw on tape? I want to see him compete in the practices and 1 on 1's, read his body language\n\n9. **Dylan Horton, TCU**\n\nI run a Facebook page (The Sideline Scout) and I have a guy that loves Dylan Horton, banging the table for him. Admittedly, I haven't watched a ton of him, and when I did, it wasn't overly impressive. I respect this guy's opinion though, so I'll be watching him throughout the week\n\n10. **Isaiah McGuire, Mizzou** \n\nLast, but certainly not least, someone I just became familiar with. McGuire popped off the screen when I watched him the other week. Seems to have all the things you look for in a quality EDGE player, just want to see him more, that's why he takes the final spot",

He really does have the physical traits to trouble the most dominant of tackles, movement beguiling for someone so big and a knack of heading to the ball. He has plays where he looks like an entire different level to those around him and seems to be an unstoppable force.\n\nYet, he is so raw, There are plays early this year where he effectively went the wrong way and opened up entire channels. He can be frustrating as he looks like he's really learning and then gets stuck on something that eliminates his effectiveness for large periods. Then there is his size and technique. His he big enough to play a 3 in a 34? Technical enough to hold the edge in a 43? What about explosive enough to play outside in the 34? His rawness and continued development makes it hard to be sure how he will truly flourish.\n\nSenior Bowl will be incredibly important to him as he can show those abilities and his learning attributes. He is new to the position and progressed so affirming he can continue to make big steps will see him fly up boards.

Sometimes it\u2019s caused by a surprising combine performance, or maybe just a late media surge that elevates the buzz of a player to high R1 status. It\u2019s wildly unpredictable, so let\u2019s try to predict it. \n\n**\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014**\n\nPredict one prospect whose stock will rapidly rise from later Day 2 to high 1st talk. Jermaine Johnson all of a sudden getting mocked top 10 mere weeks before the draft last year is a good example of this. \n\nAdditionally, predict a prospect who is currently being mocked upper first but whose stock will drop rapidly right before the draft. The 2022 QBs not named Pickett are a good example of this. Willis, Corral, Howell and even Ridder were getting high first round hype (somehow, lol) but their stocks seemed to plummet as little as days before the draft. \n\n\nMy late riser is **Rashee Rice**. One complaint is his deep speed - if he runs well his stock could vault up to the mid first. He lacks finesse sometimes, but frequently you see athleticism result in hype buildup shortly before the draft. With this current relatively underimpressive panel of 1st round WR prospects Rice\u2019s stock could be lined up for ascension. \n\nLate faller for me is gonna be **Brian Bresee**. He is an explosive athlete but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s gonna test as well as his combine hype is billing up to be. Sometimes looks lost, and totally vanishes against double teams. This is the kind of stuff that gets scrutinized close to draft day.

Teams are better off just grabbing a guy with good traits later vs using an early round pick on one. And when you look at this particular draft, there are no shortages of intriguing athletes that are worth the gamble. Why risk the investment in Mayer when you could grab a Zack Kuntz, Luke Schoonmaker, or Kemari Averett in day 3 instead and have probably just as likely of a chance to hit?

He\u2019s also thrown several \u201cwtf were you thinking?!?\u201d Interceptions, two went for TDs in the biggest game of his career. But he doesn\u2019t seem to really have a turnover problem in general, so I think a lot of NFL coaches will believe the few decision making issues can be coached out of him.\n\nHe struggled mightily doing much of anything downfield for a good part of the season, then beat up Ohio State over the top (though it\u2019s difficult to judge those because the nearest defender on any of those deep balls he completed wasn\u2019t within 10 yards). I think he *can* sort out the downfield accuracy problems, but the question is will Harbaugh\u2019s offense let him? With the core of the ground game returning including most of the OL and Blake Corum, do we get another season of McCarthy attempting 20 passes a week? If so, he\u2019s going to be one of the more interesting evaluations of the 2024 draft season. \n\nHis numbers under pressure are remarkably similar to CJ Stroud\u2019s 2022 which is\u2026 not great. He\u2019ll need to improve on those dropbacks and the downfield type throws in 2023 to offset for his lack of reps if he ends up in a run heavy offense again (which seems likely, though I hope we see them open things up a bit more). I would also like to see him do a bit more on true dropbacks (no play action, non screen pass plays) as just shy of 50% of his passing yards and nearly 60% of his TDs were on PA or screen passes which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, I just want to see him win more from true pass sets if he\u2019s going to be talked about as a potential high first round pick.",

It\u2019s hard to be run heavy and then if it\u2019s not working have to come back and bail your team out. His receivers also suck. He developed a lot over the course of the year tho, and his deep ball definitely improved and so did his pocket awareness.

He has alright decision maker (much like shea he struggles on when to hand it off and when to pull and just run it himself. He\u2019s not as bad as shea was, who just made the decision of what he was gonna do before the play rather than just reading the DE at the moment of the snap, but JJ does seem iffy with it like Shea) but he\u2019s good at holding the ball -the TCU game does not erase the other 12+ games he played where he showed he could hold onto the rock. His deep ball isnt too much of a concern for me because it\u2019s not like Michigan has those outside guys anyway and plus you had guys like andrel anthony drop perfectly thrown balls.\n\n\nFor JJ I\u2019d say the biggest concern is throwing in the pocket and ball placement. He\u2019s not throwing hospital balls to guys ala peyton manning trying to kill austin collie but he has to show he has the precision and accuracy to throw guys open more, especially in the short to medium area. He has the arm strength to pass outside the numbers/hashes rather than be a middle of the field merchant but there is still a lot to be desired on that end as well.\n\n\nHOWEVAH, I trust hardballz to get him right. I refuse to believe jake rudock will be the best qb in the Jim era."

He has alright decision maker (much like shea he struggles on when to hand it off and when to pull and just run it himself. He\u2019s not as bad as shea was, who just made the decision of what he was gonna do before the play rather than just reading the DE at the moment of the snap, but JJ does seem iffy with it like Shea) but he\u2019s good at holding the ball -the TCU game does not erase the other 12+ games he played where he showed he could hold onto the rock. His deep ball isnt too much of a concern for me because it\u2019s not like Michigan has those outside guys anyway and plus you had guys like andrel anthony drop perfectly thrown balls.\n\n\nFor JJ I\u2019d say the biggest concern is throwing in the pocket and ball placement. He\u2019s not throwing hospital balls to guys ala peyton manning trying to kill austin collie but he has to show he has the precision and accuracy to throw guys open more, especially in the short to medium area. He has the arm strength to pass outside the numbers/hashes rather than be a middle of the field merchant but there is still a lot to be desired on that end as well.\n\n\nHOWEVAH, I trust hardballz to get him right. I refuse to believe jake rudock will be the best qb in the Jim era.",

A 5 hour drive isn't that bad to go see a game and pretty soon NFL Sunday Ticket will be much more easily accessible to purchase they will get more TV revenue as well, especially considering teams with productive offenses are generally much more enjoyable to watch and the #1 overall pick will 100% be a defensive player if the Bears dont trade back.",

Richardson had 8 of those games in just 2022, and they were against, FSU, Vanderbilt, South Carolina, UGA, Missouri, Tennessee, USF, and Kentucky,",

Ballard knows the bears want to trade back and likely has a player he's been targeting since Irsay made him hire Saturday.  For fun let's say he feels good about 3 QB options which I don't think is a thing GMs do.  If Poles trades this pick to any other team he's down 1 QB option.  \n\n- Pick 2.  Texans very likely going QB and have so many picks it makes no sense for them to trade out.  They'll take a 2nd QB here.  \n\n- Pick 3.  Cardinals are now the wildcard.  They have a new GM and a new HC. This is a bad spot now for Ballard. Not only does everyone know colts need a QB, they know now if they want one of the top 3, they have to move here to get him given Cots will take one.  As he did in pick 1, he now has to worry about teams like Seattle, Detroit, Vegas, Washington etc moving up.\n\nOverall, Ballard has worked his entire life to get to his spot.  Very likely he won't get another chance.  Everyone knows he needs a QB, he needs to do what he does best.  Evaluate college level talent, make a choice and trade up to get his guy knowing if he's right the cost won't matter.  He can't just sit there and let other teams take his options from him.",

Maybe Caleb Williams opts to stay in school and Drake Maye tears his ACL.

  "selftext": "Last year, I made [this post](https://old.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/qjn003/are_bo_nix_and_jt_daniels_2022_version_of_davis/) discussing Bo Nix, JT Daniels, Brock Purdy, and Kedon Slovis in the 2022 draft. Purdy ended up being the only 1 entering the draft and was drafted in the very last pick (Mr. Irrelevant). The rest is history.\n\nSam Howell, who was in the running to be the QB1 last year, fell to the 5th round and the 6th QB drafted, yet has also shown promise as a potential starter.\n\nMy question is, who is the Purdy/Howell in this year's QB class? The similarity of Purdy and Howell is that they both started a lot of games in college (Howell started 37 games, Purdy started 46) for Power 5 schools.\n\nThe guys I like are in this class are Clayton Tune, Sean Clifford, Max Duggan, and Jake Haener.\n\nClifford started 46 games at Penn State, where he famously beat out Will Levi for the starting job. He was a 4 star recruit out of high school. The knock on him is that he'll turn 25 this summer and has a weak arm.\n\nClayton Tune appeared in 47 games for Houston. He's also older (24 in March) and played in a weaker conference (American Athletic Conference). He seems to have more NFL traits than Clifford.\n\nJake Haener started 27 games for Fresno State. He's also older (24 in March) and didn't play for a power 5 program (Fresno State in Mountain West). He has a good arm, but could have durability issue due to being undersized.\n\nMax Duggan is probably the biggest name out of the 4. He's also the youngest (22 in March) and led TCU to the national championship game. He started 43 games at TCU, but did not break out until his senior year. He seems to have a decent arm and mobility, but scattershot mechanics.\n\nWhich one of these 4 do you think have the best chance to succeed in the NFL?",

        "> He's rare - a contributing QB drafted in the late rounds\n\nHe's not the only one in his class tho. Sam Howell fell to the 5th round and could easily be Washington's starter next year. Heck, fellow 7th rounder Skylar Thompson started a playoff game.\n\n> He went to, literally, the best offensive situation in the NFL\n\nYet the narrative before this season was Shanahan couldn't win shit without Garoppolo. Before Purdy, Shanahan had one of the highest winning percentage of all-time with Garoppolo and one of the lowest winning percentage of all-time without Garoppolo and their offense was stacked the entire time. There's a reason Shanahan had a sub .500 career record until like 2 months ago. Btw Mullens and Beathard are both #2 QB for playoff teams, so it's not like they're totally inept. Tomlin went 8-8 with Duck Hodges and Mason Rudolph. Arians went 8-8 with Drew Stanton and Blaine Gabbert. Belichick went 11-5 with Matt Cassel and 7-9 with the rotten corpse of Cam Newton. You're purposely diminishing what Purdy is doing.\n\n> It's not like we thought he was much of anything coming into the season - he ended camp as third string - the team that drafted him didn't think he was any good until he actually was forced to start.\n\nThat's a false narrative and revisionist. The Niners **initially** had no intention of carrying him on their roster and likely drafted him to stash on their practice squad. They gave Nate Sudfeld $2 million guarantee to be Lance's backup and were trying to trade Garoppolo. Well, Purdy not only beat out Sudfeld (Niners flushed $2 million down the toilet when they cut Sudfeld), but forced the Niners to carry 3 QBs on their 53-man roster due to fear of losing him. Very few teams in the NFL carry 3 QBs these days."

Dude has earned his spot as a player to be taken seriously in this league.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think there's a Purdy in this draft and certainly not in every draft. I still think it happens more than ppl would think though. Personally, I believe Kyle Trask can be a solid player in this league if given the opportunity. Purdy would've never taken a snap if Jimmy and Trey didn't both go down. There's more players than one would think on NFL roster who are capable of being stars but are glued to the bench.

Sam Howell fell to the 5th round and could easily be Washington's starter next year. Heck, fellow 7th rounder Skylar Thompson started a playoff game.\n\n> He went to, literally, the best offensive situation in the NFL\n\nYet the narrative before this season was Shanahan couldn't win shit without Garoppolo. Before Purdy, Shanahan had one of the highest winning percentage of all-time with Garoppolo and one of the lowest winning percentage of all-time without Garoppolo and their offense was stacked the entire time. There's a reason Shanahan had a sub .500 career record until like 2 months ago. Btw Mullens and Beathard are both #2 QB for playoff teams, so it's not like they're totally inept. Tomlin went 8-8 with Duck Hodges and Mason Rudolph. Arians went 8-8 with Drew Stanton and Blaine Gabbert. Belichick went 11-5 with Matt Cassel and 7-9 with the rotten corpse of Cam Newton. You're purposely diminishing what Purdy is doing.\n\n> It's not like we thought he was much of anything coming into the season - he ended camp as third string - the team that drafted him didn't think he was any good until he actually was forced to start.\n\nThat's a false narrative and revisionist. The Niners **initially** had no intention of carrying him on their roster and likely drafted him to stash on their practice squad. They gave Nate Sudfeld $2 million guarantee to be Lance's backup and were trying to trade Garoppolo. Well, Purdy not only beat out Sudfeld (Niners flushed $2 million down the toilet when they cut Sudfeld), but forced the Niners to carry 3 QBs on their 53-man roster due to fear of losing him. Very few teams in the NFL carry 3 QBs these days."

Dude has earned his spot as a player to be taken seriously in this league.\n\nWith that being said, I don't think there's a Purdy in this draft and certainly not in every draft. I still think it happens more than ppl would think though. Personally, I believe Kyle Trask can be a solid player in this league if given the opportunity. Purdy would've never taken a snap if Jimmy and Trey didn't both go down. There's more players than one would think on NFL roster who are capable of being stars but are glued to the bench.

If they already did, then why did Shanahan have a historically bad record without Garoppolo before Purdy came along? If they didn't, are you gonna give Garoppolo proper credit for taking the 2019 Niners to the Super Bowl? You can't have it both ways. Either Garoppolo carried a \"shit team\" to the Super Bowl in 2019 because the \"2022 Niners\" wasn't in pace yet in 2019 **OR** they already had an \"amazing supporting cast\" in 2019, yet Shanahan couldn't do shit with this \"amazing cast\" when Garoppolo got hurt in 2020 because he's an overrated coach. So which is it? Make up your mind. You can't have it both ways. Again, elite coaches have done more with far worse QBs than Mullens/Beathard like the examples I mentioned previously.\n\nYou can't simultaneously dismiss Garoppolo/Purdy as product of an \"amazing supporting cast\" while maintaining Shanahan is an elite coach because Shanahan has a historically bad record without Garoppolo/Purdy and that \"amazing cast\" has been there since 2019 by your own admission."

Either Garoppolo carried a \"shit team\" to the Super Bowl in 2019 because the \"2022 Niners\" wasn't in pace yet in 2019 **OR** they already had an \"amazing supporting cast\" in 2019, yet Shanahan couldn't do shit with this \"amazing cast\" when Garoppolo got hurt in 2020 because he's an overrated coach. So which is it? Make up your mind. You can't have it both ways. Again, elite coaches have done more with far worse QBs than Mullens/Beathard like the examples I mentioned previously.\n\nYou can't simultaneously dismiss Garoppolo/Purdy as product of an \"amazing supporting cast\" while maintaining Shanahan is an elite coach because Shanahan has a historically bad record without Garoppolo/Purdy and that \"amazing cast\" has been there since 2019 by your own admission.",

        "The failure in logic is still yours. Placing all the blame on Shanahan and hating on him like you are is completely nonsensical. In 2017 and 2018, the 49ers had the 25th ranked and 28th ranked defenses in the NFL, respectively. Shanahan is an offensive coach, not his fault. Let's also not forget that the most productive offensive weapons on the 2017 49ers team were Marquise Goodwin and Carlos Hyde. The 2018 roster was also subject to multiple severe and season-ending injuries. Shanahan isn't God, not his fault. In 2019, when the team went to the Super Bowl, not only did they remain extremely healthy compared to 2017 and 2018, they also jumped up from having bottom tier defenses to having the 8th ranked defense in the NFL. In 2020, when they backslid back to 6-10, they once again had multiple major contributors, not just Jimmy G, go down and miss significant time with either injuries or Covid. Again, Shanahan isn't God, not his fault. The 2020 defense also, largely as a result of injuries, backslid from 8th ranked in 2019 to 17th ranked in 2020. Again, Shanahan is an offensive coach, not his fault. In 2021, when they improved to 10-7 and made the NFC Championship game, they remained healthier than in 2018 and 2020, but they actually managed to power through some injuries to fairly significant contributors. The 2021 49ers also had, once again, a top 10 defense, finishing the season ranked 9th. That brings us to this season. The 2022 49ers are playing in an NFC Championship game and are looking like the best team in the NFL, with the last pick in the draft lighting up the stat sheet at QB, no less. However, it can't be forgotten that, outside of the QB position, the 49ers have had basically no significant injuries to significant contributors on either side of the ball and are the best defense in the NFL. Not one of the best, but the best. Top 1. \n\nLet's compare to the other teams you mentioned. Bill Belichick dragged the 2008 Patriots to 11-5 with Matt Cassel at QB on the back of the 8th ranked defense in the NFL. He dragged Cam Newton and the 2020 Patriots to 7-9 on the back of the 7th ranked defense in the NFL. Mike Tomlin led the 2019 Steelers to 8-8 with Duck Hodges and Mason Rudolph at QB with the 6th ranked defense in the NFL. \n\nDo you see the pattern here? As an example of success, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid's offense get all the credit for the Chiefs Super Bowl run in 2019, but let's not forget that the 2019 Chiefs were actually the 7th ranked defense in the league. The 2015 Broncos managed to drag Peyton Manning's carcass to a Super Bowl off the back of what is possibly the greatest defense in modern NFL history.\n\nThere is a direct correlation between team success/win rate and defensive strength. For further example, of the 4 teams playing conference championship games this year, the Eagles, 49ers, Bengals, and Chiefs, only one of those teams, the Chiefs, lacks a top 10 defense, with the Chiefs being decidedly average at 16th.\n\nThe 49ers are one of the best situations for a QB in the NFL. Kyle Shanahan is pretty much a genius offensive coach and deserves all the credit he gets for building a great system and roster for his team that elevates a QB's play. Does he deserve to be seen as the only important factor? No. But he's a lot of why the 49ers are a great team. You can't blame him for years when the defense was trash and the roster was one of the 5 most injured in the NFL. That's stupid.\n\n*Edit: spelling"

  "selftext": "Need urgency on a scale of 1-10. 10 being most urgent need.\n\n**QB: 4/10**\n\nThe Steelers are obviously going to build around Kenny Pickett for the next 3 years at least. We won't be in the market for a starter or bring in any QB competition. However, Mason Rudolph is a free agent and Mitch Trubisky will likely be cut to save $8M in cap space. That leaves Pickett as the only QB on the roster. We'll need a veteran backup who can help mentor Kenny, as well as a late round draft pick to be our QB3. \n\n**RB: 2/10**\n\nNajee Harris is the clear starter and Jaylen Warren just finished a great rookie season as an UDFA backup. They're a great tandem. Anthony McFarland is on the roster and has flashed as a speedy RB3. Only small issue is that Benny Snell is a free agent who had carved out a nice role for himself on special teams. He could be brought back for close to vet minimum. \n\n**FB: 3/10**\n\nDerek Watt is a free agent but should be brought back fairly easily. If not, they could look at moving Connor Heyward to FB, though that would open up a need at TE. \n\n**WR: 6/10**\n\nDiontae Johnson and George Pickens are solid starters outside but after that it looks bleak. Miles Boykin and Steven Sims are free agents and they will likely cut Gunner Olszewski to save $2M. Boykin and Sims could be brought back for depth but they shouldn't be near the starting lineup. Calvin Austin is a wildcard after missing his rookie season to injury. I think they'll definitely be in the market for a slot receiver. \n\n**TE: 4/10**\n\nFreiermuth is a top 10 TE but we'll need a backup as Zach Gentry is a free agent. Although he's another guy who could be brought back at a cheap price for solid depth. Heyward is a good TE3 but is likely too much of an undersized tweener to rely on as a TE2. \n\n**OT: 5/10**\n\nOkorafor is a solid starter at RT who is signed for 2 more seasons. Dan Moore is a below average starter at LT, but considering he's on a 4th round rookie contract for 2 more seasons he's actually a great value from a cap perspective. There's an argument to be made for drafting a franchise LT for Pickett, but I'd be surprised if they gave up on Moore at this point. He's young and cheap enough that it's worth seeing if he can continue improving. They have basically nothing in terms of depth though, so I could see a 3rd/4th round pick being used on an OT to be the top backup and push Moore if he doesn't show improvement. \n\n**OG: 5/10**\n\nAlmost identical situation with Daniels being a solid player on a good contract at RG. Meanwhile Kevin Dotson is another below average starter but he's still so young and cheap that it's worth seeing what he can do with another year. It's important to remember that the Steelers OL showed massive improvement this year and while Dotson and Moore aren't great, they're not awful. There's a chance the Steelers look for an upgrade, but I think they'll give it another year to see what development and continuity can bring. \n\n**C: 3/10**\n\nMason Cole is another decent starter on a good contract. Backup JC Hassenauer is decent depth and will be brought back as a restricted free agent. \n\n**DL: 7/10**\n\nCam Heyward is still a top 5 DT in the league but he's getting older. We have a couple developmental prospects in Demarvin Leal and Isaiahh Loudermilk. However, the rest of the DL are free agents. Ogunjobi was decent and could be brought back, but that's no guarantee. Alualu will likely retire and Wormley is coming off a late season ACL tear. Obviously you'd like to find a prospect who can plug the run and rush the passer, but I don't think we'll shy away from a prospect who is more NT than DT. \n\n**Edge: 4/10**\n\nWe have an excellent tandem with TJ Watt and Alex Highsmith, but depth behind them is bad. The past couple years we've brought in cheap vets like Melvin Ingram and Malik Reed. We could do that again and/or find a mid round prospect. \n\n**LB: 8/10**\n\nMyles Jack is decent but slightly underwhelming. There's a chance he could be cut to save $8M. Devin Bush is a bust and won't be back. Robert Spillane is a former UDFA who the coaches like but he's very limited athletically. He could be brought back but he's not a long term answer. Even if Jack or Spillane is kept, I could see the Steelers spending big on a free agent and/or drafting a LB in the first two rounds. \n\n**CB: 9/10**\n\nThe Steelers will cut William Jackson and Ahkello Witherspoon to save $12M and $4M, respectively. Cam Sutton is a decent CB2 but not much more. He's a free agent that they will try to keep but there's a danger of overpaying him. Even if they keep him, they need to find someone who can match up against JaMarr Chase, Tee Higgins, Amari Cooper, and other WR1s. If I could pencil in a pick for the 1st round right now, it would be a CB. \n\n**S: 5/10**\n\nFS is covered: Fitzpatrick is on a Hall of Fame pace and Norwood is ok as his backup. However both SSs are free agents. Hopefully neither will be too expensive to keep though. If we lose one, we'll need depth. \n\n**ST: 4/10**\n\nNeither starter is in particular danger.",

With our OL being capable enough, I'd like to see another weapon (biggest need in the slot) added and then target OL next year.",

If anything, I could see 32 going towards IOL, or one of Broderick Jones/ Anton Harrison assuming they fall. \n\nOutside of Cam, and depending on whether or not we re-sign Ogunjobi, our defensive line is so sparse. Lukas Van Ness has been piquing my interest as of late, but I think we'd lean toward interior DLine rather than EDGE.",

        "The nice thing about Skoronski/Johnson/Jones is that all 3 have proven capable of playing guard or tackle. If any are there at 17 they could easily play them at LG or LT and either Dotson becomes the swing guy inside or Moore becomes the swing guy outside. I do think DL is the biggest need on the team though as they\u2019ve really been patching up the Tuitt loss with short term fixes the last two years + Heyward is mid 30s.",
        "Agree for sure. Like I said in the OP I would pencil in a 1st round CB now if I could. I love any of the top 4 Porter, Witherspoon, Gonzalez, and Smith. \n\nFor DL, I'm actually looking more at the NTs rather than a DT this year. I know the line between those is getting more blurred, but I'm fine grabbing a run stuffer even if it means they don't give much pass rush. We have Heyward for likely 2 more years. Leal and possibly Ogunjobi can rotate in for the second DT spot. Draft a NT this year and then next year or the year after draft the replacement for Heyward.",

Bump DL up even more. Idk what Leal is exactly. He showed some promise, but is he big enough to ever be a full time DL guy? He was playing in a 2 point stance a lot last year.",
      "replies": [
        "1. Agree they'll bring in competition for Harvin and even Boswell. Neither had a particularly good year (Boswell was clearly injured), which is why I still gave it a 4. But I doubt the competition will be more than a vet minimum free agent or UDFA. \n\n2. If there weren't so many pressing needs on defense I would obviously love to build a dominant OL. Ideally we could sign a top C and draft an OT, making Cole your backup IOL and Moore your backup swing tackle. Maybe ride out one more year with Dotson, let him walk in FA and sign/draft a top LG. That has the makings of a top 5 OL if you hit on your draft pick(s). But I just think it's much more important to infuse some youth in the defense. Highsmith is the only young up and coming player. \n\n3. Leal might be another young player to build around but as you mentioned he could be a bit of a tweener. That said, I think most of his alignments this year were just trying to give different looks. Flores definitely brought an element of creativity to the defense this year using much more diverse packages than in years past. I think the long term plan for Leal is still on the DL though, they will probably ask him to bulk up this offseason."

      "body": "QB: 3/10 - Need a long term backup but Kenny is the starter for at least the next 3 years. If they cut/trade Mitch backup QB becomes a more pressing need but probably one they address in FA.\n\nHB: 1/10 - have 2 good RBs under contract for 3 more years. Will need to replace Snell on special teams tho\n\nFB: Either 0 or 6 / 10 depending on if they re-sign Derek. Connor Heyward could probably get snaps at FB too.\n\nWR: 7/10 - You have 2 known good NFL WRs on the roster in Pickens and Diontae + a ? in Calvin Austin who missed his rookie year (I\u2019m personally pretty high on him, but they can\u2019t assume he won\u2019t be the next Senquez Golson). Otherwise there\u2019s a bunch of replacement level players. I bet they use a day 2 pick on the position. \n\nTE: 2/10 - Operating as if they\u2019ll bring back Gentry with this. He should be cheap to keep and is a good backup + blocking TE. Heyward looks promising even if I\u2019m not sure TE is where he stays long term, but it\u2019s worked so far. Muth is a stud.\n\nOT: 6/10 - Chuks Okorafor is good and got paid, locked in starter. Dan Moore has improved each year to be around average to slightly below it. I\u2019d love to see them add a high draft pick to compete with Moore but I don\u2019t expect them to do it with the way the franchise has historically valued the position. Depth is seriously lacking too. \n\nIOL: 7/10 - James Daniels is a good starter at RG. Mason Cole at C is fine but not a long term solution, a high end rookie could be an immediate improvement. Kevin Dotson at LG is the weakest link on the line, and the biggest area of improvement to make on offense. \n\nIDL: 8/10 - Heyward needs no explanation, but he\u2019s getting old. Ogunjobi was a good signing who I\u2019d love to bring back, but he isn\u2019t a long term answer either. Leal seems promising as a tweener rotational player who might wind up slimming down and moving to EDGE. Wormley is solid but is a FA that I don\u2019t expect to be a very high priority. Loudermilk is good depth. Could substantially upgrade at NT and need a real partner / heir to Cam at DT. We are still feeling the loss of Tuitt here.\n\nOLB: 5/10 - TJ Watt is a top 5 player in the league when healthy. Him staying healthy is hopefully not going to remain an issue going forward but we\u2019re not sure. Highsmith is great across from him, but he\u2019ll need paid in a year and might\u2019ve priced himself out of Pittsburgh at this point. No real noteworthy backups behind them. A later depth pick here would be great.\n\nILB: 10/10 - The worst position group on the roster, and one in desperate need of talent. Myles Jack was very average and could be a cap casualty. Devin Bush will leave in FA. Spillane is average to replacement level and is a FA. Mark robinson is interesting but seems more like a special teamer at least for now. I think this is the big area they target in FA by signing a starter or two. I\u2019d also think they draft one fairly early.\n\nCB: 8/10 - Cam Sutton is great and re-signing him needs to be offseason priority #1. Levi Wallace is a good #2. Witherspoon is streaky and I\u2019d expect him to be a cap casualty. William Jackson I\u2019d think would be cut as well but could be restructured if they want to keep him around and he\u2019s okay with a pay cut. Maulet is great at being Mike Hilton lite but shouldn\u2019t be in coverage much. James Pierre is a depth guy. Keeping Sutton and adding a legit CB1 makes this a great CB room - and would also be one of the biggest improvements that could be made. This is another spot I could see them adding in FA instead of the draft, but I\u2019d love to see them land a stud corner in the first round.\n\nFS: 3/10 - Minkah is Minkah. Depth is pretty good with Norwood. Kazee is a FA who I\u2019d like to bring back cheap for 3 safety looks + even better depth.\n\nSS: 4/10 - Edmunds is an above average starter who needs re-signed. If they don\u2019t bring him back this would shoot us to an 8 or 9. Norwood could fill in if needed but there isn\u2019t a real backup here. A late pick here for depth makes sense.\n\nK: 3/10 - Bos has earned a mulligan for last season I\u2019m not worried\n\nP: 7/10 - Harvin has been super inconsistent and not great overall. I don\u2019t expect them to make an upgrade here but it could definitely be made.\n\n\nI wrote mine before reading any of yours but it looks like we\u2019re pretty much on the same page.

Heyward probably takes over at FB with Watt likely gone, so you definitely need 1 or 2 if Gentry leaves. Our offense uses multiple TE a lot \n\nI think its a good assessment on the OL. We could easily upgrade at LT and LG if we have the resources or just take advantage of cheap young players and add some depth. \n\nId say DL is a 10 right now.

Ogunjobi coming back may be more expensive than he\u2019s worth. \n\nS should also be higher just because 2 of 3 guys who all play a lot are leaving. My guess is they bring back 1 of Kazee and Edmunds (probably Edmunds) and then try to find another value guy at #3.",

      "body": "I pretty heavily agree with just about everything. Only some slight disagreements: \n\nI think Gentry is a really solid TE2 and hope he comes back. I like Heyward and agree that he's kind of a tweener. \n\nThe Steelers love brothers. I wouldn't be shocked if they bring back Derek Watt at FB, but they are also going to be looking to re-sign one Edmunds, possibly sign another Edmunds from Buffalo, and Trey Edmunds afaik is still a FA who played a similar role to Derek and would be a lot cheaper. \n\nI also don't think Mitch or Gunner are locks to get cut. Mitch is getting paid like a high-end backup, and if both other QB's are on rookie deals I think that's palatable. I'd rather have him for $10 mil than cut him, eat $2 mil in dead cap, sign some scrub for $6 mil, and try to find some productive way to use that remaining $2 mil. Gunner was still an All-Pro returner in 2021 and was a great special teams contributor outside of returning in 2022. \n\nYou also didn't mention Robinson at ILB. I agreed with everything else, but I have a suspicion that the team is planning on mixing him in a lot in 2023. I want them to either sign an elite guy or draft one in the 1st, but part of me wouldn't be surprised if they stick with Jack, Spillane, Robinson, Allen, and another mid-round guy.\n\nI appreciate your O-line evaluation. A lot of people on the main sub want to replace Moore and Dotson, but I think they've played themselves into the awkward spot where the team doesn't feel so much pressure to do that. I think Guard is more of a need because Dotson is a FA next year and didn't look quite as good as Moore to me.",

That $8M in savings is a lot in my opinion and you could sign someone like Josh Dobbs or another lower level for maybe $3M, so I think that's worth it. However I will say that keeping Mitch does put us in line to get a compensatory pick when he leaves after 2023. \n\nGunner I think is definitely getting cut. He was benched for Sims both on offense and as a special teams returner. Just give Sims that $2M and save yourself the trouble. \n\nI think I mentioned in another comment that I'm excited for Robinson but I wouldn't plan for him to be a factor at ILB. I would sign a starting caliber FA (like you said ideally Tremaine Edmunds), keep either Spillane or Jack, and draft a rookie decently high. If Robinson can grow into something more than a backup, then great you'll be able to safely cut Spillane or Jack in 2024, but if not then no big deal."

Ideally we could sign a top C and draft an OT, making Cole your backup IOL and Moore your backup swing tackle. Maybe ride out one more year with Dotson, let him walk in FA and sign/draft a top LG. That has the makings of a top 5 OL if you hit on your draft pick(s). But I just think it's much more important to infuse some youth in the defense. Highsmith is the only young up and coming player. \n\n3. Leal might be another young player to build around but as you mentioned he could be a bit of a tweener. That said, I think most of his alignments this year were just trying to give different looks. Flores definitely brought an element of creativity to the defense this year using much more diverse packages than in years past.

  "selftext": "With the Senior Bowl less than one week away, I thought I'd start looking at the position groups and list who I'm most excited to see. Today, we look at the defensive line group\n\n1. **Karl Brooks, Bowling Green**\n\n6'4\" 300 pounds and I've seen him hit a pretty nasty spin move. Had a game this season, can't remember who it was against, he had 15 pressures. Stout build, powerful hands and lower body. I think Karl Brooks has a huge week\n\n2. **Jerrod Clark, Coastal Carolina** \n\n6'4\" 345 pounds with am 83\" wingspan. Clark has a lot intriguing NFL tools that I want to see on display. He's still learning the position, was a three star TE recruit out of HS. Putting his raw power and length on display will be huge for his stock\n\n3. **Siaki Ika, Baylor**\n\nI don't have to say much about this one, we all know Ika is a fringe first round guy. I think a good week showing he can push the pocket in pass rush could solidify him as a first rounder\n\n4. **Zacch Pickens, South Carolina** \n\nFormer 5-star with the physical traits that will make any GM drool. Never seen any kind of consistency in his game though, particularly in pass rush. The pass rush drills will be huge for him \n\n5. **Keeanu Benton, Wisconsin**\n\nThe power Benton has is incredible honestly. He's a force in the run game, a space eater more than anything. Showing he has some pass rush upside could help his stock, but I don't think you're taking him to bolster your pass rush \n\n6. **Jalen Redmond, Oklahoma**\n\nSimilar story to Pickens here. Redmond is a former 5-star who just never really put it all together. You watch him play, you see the tools, you just don't see production. He plays with a good motor, so flying around Mobile and flashing those tools will be big for him.",

I can totally see the Jets going WR at 13 if they don\u2019t see value in one of those need positions when our pick comes around. \n\nUnless Joe Douglas loves Branch or one of the lineman that falls to 13, expect the Jets to go BPA outside of CB/RB.",

It has to be D all the way for wherever the Bears make their selection.

It has to be D all the way for wherever the Bears make their selection.

McCarron and Coker were given opportunities and weren't good enough and there's a very long list of good college QBs who weren't that good in the NFL - Tim Tebow, Colt McCoy, Marcus Mariota, Jameis Winston, Johnny Manziel, Troy Smith, Jason White, Matt Leinart, etc.\n\nAnd on the flip side you do have QBs who weren't as good in college who are better in the pros - Josh Allen is the one everyone points to but there's a lot of QBs who weren't on good teams in college and weren't as highly thought of as college QBs who have been good starting QBs in the NFL.",

If I were a Panthers fan I would rather just be aggressive and try to be a team that successfully nabs one of the other 3 QBs.

The list of teams whose offenses don't improve much by him simply lining up in the backfield over their current starter is very short.\n\nHe profiles as a true game changer and the best prospect since Barkley who just had an amazing year at 25.

He had very few open opportunities, even for the NFL and was still able to produce a couple 4th quarter game winning drives.\n\nHe did make some rookie mistakes as well but really cleaned those up after his first couple starts and protected the ball well the last 8 games or so.\n\nHe did not light up the stat sheet, and probably won't unless the Steelers hire a passing game coordinator or Canada radically changes his passing game approach.\n\nI'm not 100% sold on Pickett as the future, but I'm way more comfortable and optimistic than I was on draft day.

I feel like the main reason why Fields was able to have success this year was because people were comparing him to Lamar, and there was a ton of pressure on the coaches to allow Fields to use his legs. \n\nI really cannot speak on Richardson, because I never saw him play. I am only talking about Lamar\u2019s development. Lamar was widely compared to Vick when he was in college and when he was drafted. I think, and I could have this mixed up, but I think it was said that Vick was a better passer when he played."

  "selftext": "With the Senior Bowl less than one week away, I thought I'd start looking at the position groups and list who I'm most excited to see. Today, we look at the offensive line group\n\n1. **Cody Mauch, OT/IOL, North Dakota State**\n\nThe annual FCS guy that comes in, dominates and raises his stock tremendously. I like Cody Mauch a lot already, I don't think he has any problems adjusting to the competition in Mobile. I'm interested to see if they play him at OT or IOL\n\n2. **O'Cyrus Torrence, IOL, Florida**\n\nThe consensus IOL1. Torrence had really dominant tape this year and as already viewed as a top 25 pick. I have no doubts that he won't continue to dominate down in Mobile, but it's still something you want to see. How dominant is he against the best in the country?\n\n3. **Darnell Wright, OT, Tennessee**\n\nIf you haven't watched Wright's tape against Will Anderson Jr., go do that now and you'll understand why I'm excited to see him\n\n4. **Dawand Jones, OT, Ohio State**\n\nJones can make himself a lot of money this week. Right now he's viewed as a mid 2nd guy, but with his size, he should dominate the 1 on 1's. Don't undervalue what that can do for a guys stock.\n\n5. **Andrew Vorhees, IOL, USC**\n\nI just want to see Vorhees cut loose and bully some guys. He is on Bruce Feldman's Freaks List this year where it's stated he can bench 225 for 40 reps. Watchung his tape, he's clearly ungodly strong, dominates the POA\n\n6. **Asim Richards, OT, UNC**\n\nI just started watching Asim a month or two ago, I was watching Isaiah Foskey tape and he flashed. He's a nasty finisher with a mean streak that you like to see and better pass blocker than he's given credit for. I'll really just be interested to see if they play him at OT or IOL\n\n7. **Blake Freeland, OT, BYU**\n\nBlake is a crazy athlete and I just want to see that put onto display. His technique needs some work, we all know that, just want to see those movement skills against the best competition in the country.\n\n8. **Matthew Bergeron, OT, Syracuse**\n\nBergeron grew on me as the year went on, he's a good OT prospect. Experienced at LT and RT, looks good in space, really smooth athlete. Just looking to see all that in Mobile.\n\n9. **John Michael Schmitz, IOL, Minnesota**\n\nTo me the battle is wide open for who the best center in the class is. Schmitz is a very experienced center, high IQ player, a very athletic player with great strength. A good showing in Mobile could solidify him a C1\n\n10. **Olusegun Oluwatimi, IOL, Michigan**\n\nThis is another guy who is in that conversation for best center in the class. Like Schmitz, Oluwatimi is a very experienced player with a high IQ. I think Schmitz is the better athlete, but Oluwatimi was the best player on the best OL in the country. This will be a good matchup to keep an eye on",

  "selftext": "Hey guys, here are my Draft Grades for the 2022 NFL draft, re- graded after a year. When grading the picks, I took into account:\n\n-trades\n-position value\n-of course the talent of the player\n-need\n\nFirst you see my initial evaluation and grade for every player, then my evaluation after year one and my updated grades.\nHope you enjoy it!\n\n\n1)Jaguars: Travon Walker, DE \n\n\nI like Walker from an upside perspective and I am not too worried about his missing production in college, because he wasn\u2019t really used as a typical edge rusher most of the time, but 1st Overall is a bit rich for me. Walker is at least a high-floor run defender across Josh Allen, but he may never reach his potential and with Ekwonu/Hutchinson also in this class, I would have preferred either of those two players. Still, I get the choice. Grade: B\n\n\nAfter a year, not much in the perception about this pick has changed in my opinion. Walker made an early impact, but struggled consistently impacting the game like you would expect from a 1st overall selection with just 3.5 sacks. Especially with Hutchinson being much more productive after him, that is not a good look.\nI still think Walker has loads of potential and he was good as a run defender, but right now I can\u2019t stay with my \u201cB\u201d grade. Grade after year 1: C\n\n\n2)Lions: Aidan Hutchinson, DE\n\n\nHutchinson was my best prospect in this class. In the Hutchinson vs Walker debate I didn\u2019t like that it was made out to be a high-floor vs high-ceiling debate, because I believe this isn\u2019t true. Hutchinson certainly has a higher floor than Walker with his college production and refined pass-rushing skills, but he is also unbelievably athletic and still has a lot of upside. The Lions desperately needed a new face of the franchise and bringing in a hometown star is a great step in the right direction for them. Grade: A+\n\n\nAs you can see, I loved Hutchinson in the pre-draft process and thought he should go First Overall. He didn\u2019t do anything to change that perception. I think he looked even better than most expected, showing not only his high floor, but a much higher ceiling than most thought with his athleticism. Hutchinson made an immediate impact with double-digit sacks and 3 INTs in his first season. \nThis has to stay as an A+.  1yr: A+\n\n\n3)Texans: Derek Stingley, CB\n\nI wanted Stingley badly at 9, but I think this may be a slight reach. While there is a case to be made, that Stingley is CB1 in this class, I still wonder if adding a CB with that many injury issues was really a priority for the Texans, who really have holes all over the roster and in my opinion could have taken better and more impactful players on both sides of the trenches. This grade doesn\u2019t reflect Stingley as a player, but takes position value and injury concerns into account. Grade: C+\n\n\nI think that\u2019s about right, except that there probably isn\u2019t a case to be made for Stingley to be CB1 in this class. I hope Stingley will get to play more man coverage in the scheme of the new DC/HC, because that contributed to the problems he had. Still, I felt while his season was certainly fine, that it was not what you expect when you draft a CB 3rd Overall. 1yr: C\n\n\n4)Jets: Sauce Gardner, CB\n\nThe Jets loved Sauce Gardner all throughout the process and I did as well. To me, he is CB1 in this class. I didn\u2019t particularly like this pick at first, but seeing that the Jets came out with Jermaine Johnson, who could have been selected here, I won\u2019t fault them for passing on Thibodeaux. Grade: B+\n\n\nI mean yeah Thibodeaux is good, but after the season Sauce has had this grade can not be lower than an A+. Being a Pro Bowler and 1st Team All-Pro will do that to you. Amazing pick. 1yr: A+\n\n\n5)Giants: Kayvon Thibodeaux, DE\n\nI really loved this pick. Because the Giants still had their pick at 7, they could pass up on selecting an OL here, because all three of the top OL were still there and instead choose to insert a much needed impact player on the defensive side. Thibodeaux is freakishly talented and I don\u2019t believe in the concerns about his determination. I think this is a great pick that improves the Giants immediately. Grade: A\n\n\nThibodeaux had a bit of a rough start to the year because of injury, but it certainly seemed like he began to turn it around later in the year. While 33 solo tackles, 4 sacks and 2 FF certainly don\u2019t jump off the screen, I still love his potential and what he can bring to this defense. 1yr: B+\n\n\n6)Panthers: Ikem Ekwonu, OT\n\nI like this. I was worried the Panthers were neglecting their huge OL issues by taking a QB here, but they did the smart thing in building around said QB first. Ekwonu is a nasty blocker in the run game, who may play guard his first year, while adding refinement in pass-protection. Grade: A\n\n\nEkwonu was certainly a great pick. I thought he would look rough in pass-protection, which was true his first few games, but I was unbelievably impressed to see how well he did in that aspect later in the season. Also, he is just totally crazy in the running game. This was a perfect pick by the Panthers. 1yr: A+\n\n\n7)Giants: Evan Neal, OT\n\nThis is a perfect pick. There is a good case to be made that Neal is the most balanced at most pro-ready OT in this class. Also, the Giants have a huge hole at RT and Neal plays RT the best in this whole class. Grade: A+\n\n\nEvan Neal certainly had his struggles, especially early in the season, where he often just looked off- balance and overmatched. He allowed 7 sacks, which is a lot for a highly-drafted rookie. I still felt like he got it together towards the end of the season until he was absolutely bullied by the Eagles in the divisional round. \nI am not grading this too harshly (just reminding you of how Andrew Thomas first season went) but this can\u2019t stay at an \u201cA+\u201d. 1yr: C\n\n\n8)Falcons: Drake London, WR\n\nUgh, I just don\u2019t know about this one. London is a good prospect, but he was my WR3 in this class, although those 3 were close together. I get that the Falcons are desperate for WR help, but I think they should have added more blue-chip talent here, instead of taking a WR of whom we believe, that he might have separation issues. I don\u2019t hate it, but they could have done better. Grade: C\n\n\nWell I think this is the first one where I was off by more than a bit. While London didn\u2019t have the production other WRs in this class had, I thought he looked fine separating and had a really good year, despite being in a run-heavy offense. His down-phase in the middle of the season can be attributed more to Mariota being a bad QB than London not being a good receiver. I still think he is WR3 in this class, but it should be graded higher than this and he fits their offense really well. 1yr: B+\n\n\n9)Seahawks: Charles Cross, OT\n\nThis is a great outcome for Seattle. Cross is the best pass-protector in this class and one of the best in pass-protection coming out of college in the last years. He needs more experience and refinement in the run game, but in his limited snaps he has really shown promise in that area, which makes me not worried about the fit. The Hawks desperately needed a franchise LT, great pick!      Grade: A\n\n\nI thought Cross had a really solid year starting the whole year. He had games where he struggled (especially against Nick Bosa, but honestly who doesn\u2019t), but for a rookie LT I thought he did really well. What really encouraged me was how he did in the run game, because he didn\u2019t have a lot of snaps in college in run-blocking.  The Seahawks desperately needed this and it was a great pick (although he wasn\u2019t even the best rookie OT on his team). 1yr: A-\n\n\n10)Jets: Garrett Wilson, WR\n\nI like this fit very much. The Jets were very interested in Deebo Samuel and Wilson can be used very similarly to loosen up the offense. He has blazing speed, is very experienced in jet sweeps and outside zones and is a great route-runner who especially excels in pacing his routes. This is a good pick that improves Zach Wilsons supporting cast by a lot. Grade: A\n\n\nMan, Garrett Wilson is amazing. He had terrible QB play but still caught 83 passes for over 1000 yards and 4 TDs. He also has a legitimate shot winning OROY.\nHe has great hands, good separation ability and just looks like a big-play threat every time he has the ball. 1yr: A+\n\n\n11)Saints: Chris Olave, WR\n\nI would have liked Olave just a tad later than this, but I get it. His smooth route-running and finesse in finding open space against zone coverage is tremendous. Paired with Michael Thomas and Kamara, I think this is a tremendous improvement offensively. I also felt like the trade-up was good, because of the two WRs already taken. Grade: B+\n\n\nChris Olave is amazing. He also suffered from mediocre QB play and you have to wonder where the Saints are going as a franchise, but his route- running combined with an elite deep-threat ability (highest Depth of Target by all rookie WRs) is amazing. I don\u2019t like the trade- up that much in hindsight, because for a truly directionless franchise, it meant losing even more future assets, but I can\u2019t grade this lower. 1yr: A-\n\n\n12)Lions: Jameson Williams, WR\n\nI love this. Trading up 20 spots for a wide receiver may seem like a bit of a bad business, but they really didn\u2019t give up a whole lot to my surprise and they get my WR1 in this whole class through that trade-up. With Hutchinson and Williams, the Lions have new stars on both sides of the ball, ready to make an impact. I don\u2019t do this with trades normally, but this is an easy grade.    Grade: A+\n\n\nBecause of his injury, I can not say a lot about this after year one. It was expected that he\u2019d miss a lot of year 1. I think, that the Lions are a lot closer than even they thought, which makes the trade- up an even better move, though. Grade: A+\n\n\n13)Eagles: Jordan Davis, DT\n\nI like how aggressive Howie Roseman is when it is draft time. They jumped the Ravens, who I think would have taken Davis for sure, to take their Fletcher Cox replacement. I like Davis, he is an absolute freak of nature. At worst he is a two-down presence that stops any chance the run game has. At best, he further develops his pass-rushing skills and becomes a three-down presence at DT/NT for years to come. Either way, I think this is a good trade+ pick. Grade: A\n\n\nDavis only played limited snaps and his stats don\u2019t show a huge impact (15 tackles), but his PFF grade of 71.4 shows, that he made a much bigger impact than those stats show. He was absolutely devastating as a run defender (as expected). I hope to see him a bit more in a 3 down role, but thought he showed good promise. 1yr: B\n\n\n14)Ravens: Kyle Hamilton, S\n\nI hate how the Ravens always get good players while just sticking where they are. Hamilton may not be the generational prospect he was once touted as in the pre-draft process, but he is a damn good football player.\nHis testing was just solid, but with his intelligence he should still be able to make a big impact on the field. This may end up being a huge steal. Grade: A\n\n\nI thought the way the Ravens used Hamilton really benefited him. He looked lost in coverage earlier and they made life easier on him by using him a lot in 3 safety sets close to the line of scrimmage. He did really well with 48 solo tackles, 2 FF, but still struggled in coverage (43 receptions allowed on 52 targets). Still, an 82.3 PFF grade shows what a talented player he is. His coverage skills don\u2019t allow me to leave this grade as highly though. 1yr: B+\n\n\n15)Texans: Kenyon Green, OG/OT\n\nI think this is just fine. If the Texans had selected Green at 13, I would have been a bit irritated, but after trading back, I guess you cant complain too much. Green should at least be a difference-maker in the run game, which the Texans really need after having the worst run game in the league last year.   Grade: B\n\n\nWell Kenyon Green certainly had a bad first year. He started the entire year (823 snaps played), but allowed a whopping 12 penalties and 4 sacks as a guard. His PFF grade of 37.7 just shows what you could easily see (which is that he didn\u2019t really play well. 1yr: D+\n\n\n16)Commanders: Jahan Dotson, WR\n\nI hate this. The Commanders must have loved Dotson, otherwise it would not have made any sense to trade down from 11 and miss out on Olave and Williams. I think Dotson is fine, but this is not a good value pick here as I had him more in the range of 25-35 maybe. Grade: C-\n\n\nI was wrong. While I still think that staying put at 11 and taking a guy like Olave would have been better, Dotson has played really well even with subpar QB play and was well worth the pick at 16. 1yr: B\n\n\n17)LA Chargers: Zion Johnson, OG\n\nI know many Chargers fans love this more than taking Penning, but I think he would have been a better choice here. Still, with many wide receivers off the board, bolstering the IOL seems like a sensible thing to do and I like Zion Johnson as a prospect. I thought they may take another corner here in McDuffie, but again, I am fine with the pick. Grade: B\n\n\nI agree with myself after a year (except for the Penning part). 1yr: B\n\n\n18)Titans: Treylon Burks,WR\n\nI hated what the Titans were doing (except getting Malik Willis that late, but more on that later). Trading away AJ Brown when you just were the No.1 seed in the AFC is just not good and looking at the war room, it seemed like Vrabel was (rightfully) pissed at that. Now, they select Burks, whom I absolutely like as a prospect, but who probably will not help right away to a team that needs help right away. This is bad process and the grade doesn\u2019t reflect what I think of Burks at all. It reflects what I think of the Titans decision to trade AJ Brown essentially for Treylon Burks.   Grade: D\n\n\nWhile I still think trading away AJB will haunt this franchise for a long time and that it was terrible process, this grade can\u2019t stay this low, because of the player Burks looks to be already. 1yr: C+\n\n\n19)Saints: Trevor Penning, OT\n\nI like it. The Saints needed to get a WR and an OT and they got both without having to reach. Penning may need a bit of time as he is very raw and a penalty-magnet, but he has significant talent and I am hopeful in his potential. This is the range where I had him graded, but I didn\u2019t expect him to last by pick 17, so this is also a pretty good value.  Grade: B+\n\n1yr: Inc.\n\n20)Steelers: Kenny Pickett, QB\n\nI never expected Pickett to last that long, but I still struggle to understand this pick. The Steelers just got Trubisky as a bridge-QB so why not swing for the fences and grab the high-upside guy in Malik Willis? Instead they take Kenny Pickett, who I thought would go to a team that needs improvement at QB right away. The Steelers aren\u2019t that team. They had Trubisky in place to let someone sit behind him for a while. This makes no sense. I get that Pickett is a hometown player, but is he really an improvement over Trubisky? I mean i just don\u2019t know. Added to that, the concerns I already had with Pickett (small hands, fumbled wayyyy too often), I can\u2019t grade this favorably.   Grade: D+\n\n\nI hate reading my take on this, but that\u2019s why I like doing those re-grades of my instant reactions. Pickett is clearly the best QB of those of whom we thought they may go early and he has shown great improvement already in his time in Pittsburgh. While I feel like he may not be like a Top 15 QB, he will give the Steelers stability at the position for a while on a rookie deal. 1yr: B+\n\n\n21)Chiefs: Trent McDuffie, CB\n\nThe Chiefs are a well-run organization and it just shows. They trade up a few spots and get what I think is easily the CB3 in this class and my 12th ranked prospect overall. McDuffie has size-concerns, but putting those aside he just has everything you could ever want from a cornerback. I love his toughness and I really like how he plays much bigger than he is- you would probably expect him to be a liability in run support, but that is not the case at all. He may even end up playing safety, which I think would fit his skillset very well. Having lost Mathieu/Ward, this is a great value, that fills a need. Grade: A\n\n\nMcDuffie is really playing well for the Chiefs and making this pick well worth it. They absolutely needed a CB for this defense and they got one at pick 21. This was a solid pick. 1yr: B+\n\n\n22)Packers: Quay Walker, LB\n\nI like Quay Walker, but not over Devin Lloyd or Jermaine Johnson. I get his upside, but while the Packers did the right thing in refusing to reach for a receiver, this just feels like bad value to me. Johnson would have been the better player at a more pressing position of need and selecting him here, the Packers still would have been able to land Walker/Lloyd at 28, probably. Grade: C+\n\n\nWalker played a lot better than I expected in his rookie year. With 87 solo tackles and 3 FF he also made an impact immediately. He struggled a bit in coverage and of course was ejected 2 times for shoving training staff, which is absolutely idiotic. I still think Lloyd or Johnson would have probably been better picks, but this is fine. 1yr: B\n\n\n23)Bills: Kaiir Elam, CB\n\nThe Bills really needed to improve their secondary across from T.White of course. Elam is a long, physical corner, who is really talented in man coverage. I had him ranked around pick 23-27, so this is fine value and a smart trade-up. Grade: B+\n\n\nI was a bit disappointed by Elam, because he was in a timeshare at his position and when it mattered most in the playoffs, he wasn\u2019t playing until an injury. Still, he showed flashes later in the year (2 good INTs). 1yr: C+\n\n\n24)Cowboys: Tyler Smith, OT\n\nI love the pick. I know many people didn\u2019t and I also know that Smith is pretty raw, but he is just so immensely talented and I don\u2019t think he is as raw as people often say. He is also really young, so there is lots of room for improvement. I would have loved Jermaine Johnson here though.  Grade: B\n\n\nTyler Smith really impressed me. While 13 penalties and 6 sacks allowed are certainly in need of improvement, I never thought he would start right away and play as well as he did all in all. This was a great pick by the Cowboys to replace Collins. 1yr: A-\n\n\n25)Ravens: Tyler Linderbaum, C\n\nThere are a few aspects that go into this. First, value-wise, this is a terrific selection. Second, I couldn\u2019t believe that the Ravens got pick 23 for giving up Marquise Brown, that is also terrific value, to which they added by trading back two more spots with the Bills. But third, I am surprised they took Linderbaum: he has legitimate size concerns and he played his whole college-career almost exclusively as a zone-blocker. The Ravens never block in zone-schemes, they always block in gap-/power-schemes, so I am really not sure about the fit, which is why this isn\u2019t graded higher.  Grade: B\n\n\nMy worries about the scheme seem to have been overblown. While I think he would probably be a better fit with more zone-blocking, he consistently did well in both the running and passing game in his first year. Good pick. 1yr: B+\n\n\n26)Jets: Jermaine Johnson, DE\n\nI can not express how much I love this pick. The Jets didn\u2019t have to give up that much to get a top 15 player in this class at a valuable position which was also a huge position of need for them. Johnson and Lawson should be a really good pass-rushing duo.  Grade: A+\n\n\nJohnson didn\u2019t play a huge amount of snaps on a talented D-Line, but when he did I thought he really flashed. I was really surprised he lasted that long and that surprise has not gone away. 1yr: B+\n\n\n27)Jaguars: Devin Lloyd, LB\n\nThis is a fine pick, however I didn\u2019t particularly like the trade-up that came with it. Lloyd is my LB1 in this class and it really wasn\u2019t too close and although the Jaguars spent big on Oluokun in FA, I like getting an uber-talented player like Lloyd here, who can blitz, cover and defend the run.  Grade: B\n\n\nWhile Lloyd started out hot, I thought he really had his struggles especially in coverage. He made an impact with 110 total tackles (81 solo), but he also had too many negative plays. 1yr: B-\n\n\n28)Packers: Devonte Wyatt, DT\n\nI like this pick as a compliment to Kenny Clark. Wyatt is an explosive athlete, who I think still has a lot of room for improvement. I also still thought it was the right choice value-wise to not pick a receiver here. This is all in all a solid choice, nothing spectacular, but solid.  Grade: B\n\n\nWyatt was a solid choice. He played limited snaps for the packers and in those snaps was graded pretty solid by PFF (69.9, nice). 1yr: B\n\n\n29)Patriots: Cole Strange, OG\n\nWell wow. Cole Strange is a fine prospect at guard, but picking him at 29 is just not good. I know many people will say well it\u2019s New England, he will be a great guard for a decade and you know they may be right, but his just isn\u2019t a smart use of resources. I wont give this an \u201cF\u201d, because they traded back first, though. Grade: D\n\n\nWell I still don\u2019t like this pick and I don\u2019t think Strange played all that good, but my initial reaction was too harsh. He started for nearly the entire year (982 offensive snaps) and he was solid. 1yr: B-\n\n\n30)Chiefs: George Karlaftis, DE\n\nKarlaftis may not be the sexiest pick at edge, but he has a never-stopping motor and is a great worker, who provides really fine value here at a position of need for the Chiefs.  This is another really solid instant-impact pick by the Chiefs here. Grade: A-\n\n\nKarlaftis has turned into a bit of a pass-rush specialist for the Chiefs, having logged 7 sacks in his rookie season. I though he was a bit out of place in the run game sometimes, but he still looked really solid. 1yr: B\n\n\n31)Bengals: Daxton Hill, S\n\nI LOOVE Dax Hill. He is such a fine prospect at either slot/nickel corner or free safety. However, I am a bit torn here, because I don\u2019t quite know where he will fit in. I hope he isn\u2019t supposed to replace Jessie Bates on the cheap, because I think that would be a stupid move, but I also don\u2019t really see them starting Hill over Hilton in the slot. We will see. Grade: B\n\n\nMan. Dax Hill was one my personal favorites in this draft, but he just didn\u2019t really play meaningful snaps this year. Tough to grade. 1yr: C+\n\n\n32)Vikings: Lewis Cine, S\n\nI like Cine, don\u2019t get me wrong and it is a position of need for the Vikings. I hate the process, though. Trading back from 12 to 32 with a division rival to allow them to pick a face of the franchise star WR is bad enough, but doing this with as terrible of a return as they got (essentially a 3rd and moving up 12 in the 2nd for moving down 20(!!!!) in the first) is unbelievable. They could have gotten so many better players between those picks and I just refuse to ignore this. Again, this has not much to do with Cine, who is one of my favorite players in the draft, but that was bad.  Grade: D-\n\n\nMy problem with this pick still remains and I hate it a lot. Like they made the Lions better, which they couldn\u2019t afford at the time and really want undone after the type of season the Lions had. Cine also suffered a season-ending injury in Week 4, which doesn\u2019t help. A WR at 12 would have, with Justin Jefferson the only threat at WR.\n1yr: F",

Now, that's no guarantee that they're going to be good players (although I'd argue at this point that I can confidently say Dotson and Robinson will be at least good players, if not excellent). Olave may end up being the best player of that bunch long-term, but the other guys' ability to develop into serviceable starters should be weighed into a grade as well.

Obviously this grade can change since he was seen as such as project, but simply going off a year later I think it's fair to give the Jags a D for Walker. They were a playoff team and passed on players who performed better not only in their rookie year, but also look like they'll be better in the future.\n\n2. Texans have to be a D or F IMO. They not only picked the wrong CB, the other of which looks like a future Hall of Famer, but they were in the position where they could take *any* position so long as it was the best player. \n\n3. Saints have to have an F-. They completely misevaluated where their team stood.

He is best in a gap run scheme where he can follow lead blockers and set up his blocks. He is super patient. He flashes some ability to change lanes and to be a one cut runner. Good burst and top end speed. Runs low with balance. Flashes some ability to create yards, but always unable to make the last defender miss. Super tough to bring down. Plays like he's 20 lbs bigger. Not a game changer as a receiver but capable. Really a great blocker due to his FIQ, vision, and effort.\n\nMy notes on his blocking:\n\n>Able to spot presnap blitzes. IDs blitzes from the second level, even if delayed. Meets the defender with a low center of mass. Lacks elite strength but will lay his body out for the block.\n\n[One of my favorite reps from him](https://youtu.be/SQkAy_byQHI?t=175) with notes (Minnesota, Q2 5:30):\n\n>Here is an absolute monster of a block from Brown. In shotgun from 11 personnel, Minn is sending the OLB on a blitz. Brown is lined up to the QB's right while the free rusher is coming from the left. Brown is eyeing it the entire time. He is super quick to recognize this, then goes to attack the LB low, almost with a tackle. He really lunges into the block and puts his body on the line. Love to see this level of FIQ and effort.",

I think he had the best year and he is the most impressive technically.  But his frame could be an issue if he doesn\u2019t add more weight and also his stature is just average.\n\nJoey Porter on the other hand is really long and is able to do things with his length that Witherspoon can\u2019t do.  Porter\u2019s not as quick but he\u2019s definitely not slow.  \n\nChristian Gonzalez is probably the best prospect because he is the most athletic, has the best hips, and is 6\u20192.\n\nBut I\u2019d say that Christian Gonzalez didn\u2019t have as good of a year as Joey Porter or Devon Witherspoon imo.\n\nI think Christian Gonzalez projects the best because he will be able to better keep up with some of the faster WRs while matching size."

As for the year off Chase wasn't injured all of his year off and not to mention Chase is a significantly higher level athlete than JSN.\n\nOverall JSN is a good prospect; excellent route runner, great hands and contested catch ability, as well as toughness and shiftiness to make plays after the catch.

He's got a truly elite combination of length, fluidity, explosiveness, and speed which he uses to be an special player after the catch. He's also got more to him as route runner than a lot of people give him credit for though he's not close to Addison and JSN in that category. I he's also really inconsistent and doesn't always play as physical as you'd like given his size in his routes and at the catch point.\n\nAlso I wouldn't count out Zay Flowers as a top 20 pick; he's a special athlete with dynamic movement skills, great understanding of space and how and when to use that athleticism, and terrific ball skills that lets him outplay his size at the catchpoint.\n\nI don't think any WR this year is going top be a top 10 guy though; Wilson, Williams, and London are higher level prospects than anyone this year, and Olave had a skill set that was extremely valuable and directly translated to the NFL, and Chase, Waddle, and Smith the year before were all up another level from them.

      "body": "Personally I like using both endzone shots and wide sideline shots some stadiums offer. The first thing you have to do is discern what his responsibility is every play pre-snap and if that changes post-snap. Is he in man? Is he in zone? What does the called coverage dictate him to do as far as leverage and forcing his opponent to do? Is he expecting safety help/is he the one who\u2019s supposed to help? How fast does he realize it\u2019s a run or pass play? Can he predict route concepts based on the personnel, formation, alignment and release? Is he communicating changes with his teammates effectively? \n\nThen you have to look at the techniques they\u2019re using once the play is live. Are they jamming at the line/are they big enough to even do so? What does that jam look like and is it consistent? What is his initial drop looking like in terms of weight distribution, foot speed, eye discipline? How well does he play trail, press, etc? Is he too handsy or not handsy enough? How does he react to different releases and moves within routes? Does he have the range to project to make plays outside the different hashes in the nfl? How in sync are his feet hips and hands? If he\u2019s beat does he have good tools to be able to recover? Does he look for the ball in the air(this one is pretty big imo- I watched Xavien Howard at baylor be a walking PI call because he never looked for the ball but he was ALWAYS in position to make plays)? Is he a willing tackler in the run game? Does he adapt to his man through the game and start to learn his moves and tendencies?\n\nThere\u2019s more I\u2019m leaving out but I think in general, DB is a very honest position to scout. You can\u2019t really hide or get your mistakes covered up by teammates all the time. For a lot of guys eye test tends to be a pretty solid indicator of talent and skill, but matching that with the specifics of their actual physical traits, mental aptitude for pattern recognition, reaction time, etc is where it becomes hairy. And a lot of things you wont have context for because it comes from the film room. As in, a guy watched film on a team one week, took some stuff from that, and applied it to his play against them. It\u2019s hard to know where that line is between being intuitive and it being a film junkie. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a problem with either of them so long as the work ethic is there but just something to keep in mind that may come up.",

  "selftext": "With the Senior Bowl less than two weeks away, I thought I'd start looking at the position groups and list who I'm most excited to see. Today, we look at the tight ends\n\n1. **Elijah Higgins, Stanford**\n\nHiggins played WR at Stanford and he is listed at WR on the Senior Bowl roster. However, Nagy said on the \"Move The Sticks\" Senior Bowl roster reveal show that Higgins would work with the TE's. You may not be familiar with Higgins since he was in the anemic Stanford offense, but he's an intriguing TE convert prospect. Listed at 6'3\" 240, Higgins is a big target with a large catch radius. He's a smooth athlete and can outrun guys in the open field. Primarily worked out of the slot because he was too big for cornerbacks and too fast for LB's, mismatch nightmare. It'll be interesting to see how he looks as a TE.\n\n2. **Luke Musgrave, Oregon State**\n\nMusgrave is a popular pick for TE2 behind consensus TE1 Michael Mayer. At 6'6\" 250 it's being reported he's going to run somewhere in the high 4.4's to low 4.5's and jump somewhere in the mid 30\". Injuries cost him most of this season so it'll be good to see if he's fully healthy and show off that athletic ability to fully takeover that TE2 spot.\n\n3. **Davis Allen, Clemson**\n\nWe see a bit of a drop-off here as far as athleticism goes. While he's isn't a top end athlete, Davis Allen is versatile. He lined up everywhere for Clemson. Anywhere from a traditional Y TE, HB, and big slot. He also has a huge catch radius. Showing off thay versatility in Mobile could really help his stock.\n\n4. **Payne Durham, Purdue**\n\nI watched a lot of Purdue games this year because I'm a huge Charlie Jones fan and I wanted to watch as much of him as I could. Every game I'd see Payne Durham finding an opening in the zone and making the catch, I don't think I ever seen him drop a pass. He's a huge guy at 6'5\" 265, has lined up mainly at a Y alignment, but he did play some HB. I think showing off how good of a blocker he is will help his stock.\n\n5. **Will Mallory, Miami**\n\nTake what I said about Payne Durham and apply it to Mallory. Sure hands and offers you some versatility. What separates Durham to me is his blocking ability. Durham is stocky and just looks stronger than Mallory. Mallory is a willing blocker, but I think his play strength holds him back.\n\n6. **Cameron Latu, Alabama**\n\nI was never a huge Cameron Latu fan, I think he's a solid college TE, but I don't see him being super effective NFL player. He's an okay athlete with okay length. He's play strength is eeh. I just don't see it. Will he prove me wrong in Mobile? I hope he does, won't be the first time.",

Front office changes were the start using this [coaching tracker](https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-coaching-gm-tracker-latest-news-interviews-developments-in-2023-hiring-cycle) as a general outline. That would go on to influence team transactions (using OTC for numbers) and in turn free agency. I tried to get on top of any free agents I thought would move the needle for teams, so you won't see guys like OJ Howard or Efe Obada represented (as much as I love those guys).\n\nThis is not really an interpretation of what I think will or should happen, especially for the draft. I wanted to explore the idea of a Carolina trade for Bryce Young, and the rest of the draft sort of grew out of that. \n\nI've watched just over 50 prospects for this year's draft, and not all of them are going in this draft (which is 5 rounds). I used a combination of the Mock Draft Database Big Board, PFF's Big Board, The Draft Network's Big Board, and mock drafts from Daniel Jeremiah and Dane Brugler to fill in the patches for prospects I haven't gotten to.\n\nAs always, let me know what feedback you have.",

        "Here's why we won't: TE is devalued in our style of offense. It's why we were so willing to move on from Hock before paying him. It's a blocking position except at the goal line and trick plays (Wright's TD against the Jets, for example).\n\nPlus our play at TE actually improved once we got rid of Hock. Wright, Zylstra and Mitchell combined for something like 9 TDs afterwards, whereas we only had 2 TE TDs beforehand. The blocking was much better. For all of his reputation, Hock was never the blocker he was purported to be.\n\nFinally, they'll want to see what they really have in Mitchell. He was hardly removed from his injury and only looked about half recovered athletically based on Virginia Tech tape. I expect a major leap from him this year.\n\nNot only do I not see us taking one high, I could easily see us not taking one at all.",

Everyone has a different opinion on who CB1 is in this class, but I like Witherspoon a lot. That\u2019s a solid pick and one that makes sense.\n\nTrading down made sense on my first pass of this mock, but I don\u2019t think Mayer is the pick there. You\u2019re a Vikings fan, so you understand what our view on TEs is right now. Mayer is a special talent, but I don\u2019t think Brad Holmes traded Hockensen away just to draft his replacement in the first round. That just doesn\u2019t strike me as smart roster management. If he were available, I could see them taking Darnell Washington due to his blocking ability, but you have him going earlier, of course.\n\nWhile secondary is a huge need, I think you\u2019re overloading the room with rookies. DB is a tough position to transition to, and adding three rookies to that unit, which is already super young, with no veteran acquisitions in FA, doesn\u2019t seem right. Since you drafted a safety anyway, I think it would be better to stay put at 1.18 and draft Brian Branch. In the second round, reinforcing iDL by taking Kancey or Smith would be better, I think.\n\nI don\u2019t know a ton about Xavier Hutchinson, but in this mock WR is still a need, and I like the iOL pick too.\n\nOverall, really good work, just not quite what I would\u2019ve done.

With us drafting Johnston, I\u2019d say to hold that second and the cap space and look to improve the rest of the team.

The later rounds are okay with Chris Smith being a decent depth safety but edge depth is literally the last thing we need.\n\nPS: it\u2019s far more accurate to list DC as Mayo/Steve Belichick than Bill.

God damn dude, there's only so many snaps that can go out and both Chubb and Phillips are going to get the lion's share, so we'd be forced to bench our top 5 DT tandem of Sieler and/or Wilkins(who we have no depth behind really).  I like Achane, so that pick isn't the worst, but I imagine we'd be taking a hard look at Mazi Smith and Noah Sewell.  Our LB group was a bit all over the place and you didn't sign anyone.  I think our team is vastly better if we go Noah/Mazi into Freeland/Vorhees(LG was our worst position.  OT was only a problem because we had 4-5 injuries at that position), then take Sean Tucker/Wypler/Overshawn.  Our areas of concern are RB, OL, CB, and LB.  Id take whoever the best OL is and figure out how to get it to work in camp.",

We did draft James Mitchell to replace hock and he\u2019s gotten better as a rookie and the Brock wright Shane zylstra combo has been productive. I would be genuinely surprised if we take a TE with our first 4 picks considering that the defense is garbage. With Levi Onzuwurike being uncertain due to back injuries, the 3 tech DT is a position of need and this FO values the trenches a lot and I\u2019d expect a DT somewhat early.

Second, we never addressed DT which is probably the 2nd biggest need on this team. We were obliterated in the run game on defense and we need a 3-tech that can help in the run game. For safety, if Deshone Elliot re-signs, it won\u2019t be a need imo. If he doesn\u2019t, Tracy Walker has already show he can play in the box, then Kerby can play FS. I would\u2019ve much rather seen a DT like Gervon Dexter who was still on the board, or Jack Campbell, Carter, or Foskey. This is minor, but I\u2019d rather have Manny Forbes than Stevenson. I don\u2019t hate the WR pick if Reynolds doesn\u2019t re-sign, but I think he will and I\u2019d rather sign a FA in the event he doesn\u2019t.

Belichick tends to look for guys that have performed well against him, and Davis has not done that.\n\nGiven the way the board fell, with Jones, Johnson, and Skoronski gone, I think a trade-down could be the way to go... though once I start seeing all the rest of the players I'd hope for the Pats to target go, I'd trade out or down again from 28."

  "selftext": "\nQB: 3/10 it\u2019s going to be Dak \n\nRB: 9/10 Pollard & Zeke both have a very good chance of not being on the roster TP maybe with a tag is possible idk if we pay him. Zeke also could return on a paycut but I assume he\u2019s gone.\n\nWR: 10/10 Ceedee is our number 1 & became a true alpha. But our offense has no speed besides Pollard, Gallup off his acl injury hasn\u2019t been good I\u2019d give him another year to see since those take about a year. Tolbert wasn\u2019t able to see the field he got redshirted we might see him next year, Noah Brown is FA too.\n\nTE: 4/10 Schultz a FA we could resign depending on what he\u2019s asking but we have 3 young tight ends on the roster Mckeon, Hendershot & Ferguson. If Dalton does walk I\u2019d assume it\u2019s a veteran.\n\nLT: 7/10 Depends on how they see Tyler Smith he had to play both LT/LG this season due to OL injuries. I\u2019d assume Tyron is LT day 1 but he\u2019s aging tho \n\nLG: 7/10 Same as LT \n\nC: Biadiasz is passable maybe a late round pick will be spent on one \n\nRG: 3/10 Zack Martin. Could draft his replacement & let him learn behind him in a later round\n\nRT: 5/10 10 if we don\u2019t resign Steele it\u2019s a must draft \n\nDE: 6/10 Lawrence Armstrong Sam Williams Goldston we probably need another & we most likely will grab a vet min DE or 2 as well too.\n\n\nDT: 9/10 Hankins Osa were our only positive players at this position we need to improve on this dramatically need a gap eater \n\nLB: 2/10 Micah is Micah. We spent a good amount of a capital too, Cox & Clark have been drafted recently. If we don\u2019t sign LVE I\u2019d assume we\u2019d grab a cheap vet.\n\nCB: 10/10 Diggs our CB1. Brand was a great steal in the 5th round, he play inside or out but I\u2019d like add another to the mix. Anthony Brown is also a FA & he\u2019s coming off an acl tear. This likely is our biggest need in the 1st to address since the WR class isn\u2019t that good this will more than likely will be it \n\nSafety: 2/10 Hooker is fine Kearse is great for us Wilson is a free agent we\u2019ll see what happens with that but we have two backups in Izzy & Bell that can play so I doubt we draft one early. \n\nKicker: lol \n\n\nI\u2019d say: CB, WR, RB, whatever position they decide on Tyler isn\u2019t are the most likely 1st round picks.",

I'd imagine we restructure Zeke or tag pollard, but can't see us bringing both back. \n\nWR: 9/10 agreed this position is a must address, but could see Jerry trading with a team going into a rebuild (Dhop, Mike Evans, Godwin?)\n\nOT: 8/10 Grouping this together as Cowboys haven't seemed to care about traditional position and prefer swinging players. I'm pretty confident we'll re-sign Steele, but even so we can't count on Tyron for more than 5 games, and need some depth to replace Peiters. \n\nOG/C: 7/10 we likely resign Mcgovern for relatively cheap and address our aging OTs. Really comes down to if this franchise see's Tyler Smith's future at tackle or guard. \n\nTE: 4/10 Schultz is likely gone barring Jerry rewarding his mediocre performance with a massive contract. I imagine the Cowboys prefer to roll the dice with the young blood\n\nDE/Edge: 0/10 Considering Micah in this group, Jerry will try to keep Fowler and let the strongest position group on the roster roll. \n\nDT: 7/10 Cowboys need some help here, but would imagine using a late round selection + FA cheaper vet to help in run support. \n\nLB: 8/10 LVE should be the Cowboys top priority to re-sign. This D looked like a shell of itself when he was out this season, but injury risk to LVE is huge and Dallas should look to address this through the draft as they have historically. \n\nCB: 6/10 I feel much better about CB than I did 3 weeks ago with Izzy and Bland stepping up big. Lewis also back, but we likely draft someone here. \n\nSafety: 3/10 If Cowboys re-sign Dono we likely roll with the group, if not could see a pick here. \n\nKicker: 10/10 Don't expect anyone drafted here, but do expect an open competition next fall to find a guy\n\nIf I had to guess: \n\nR1-2: OL/LB\nR3-4: WR/RB\nR4-5: DT/CB/WR again\nR6-7: QB/RB/K?",

I think this particular ranking is a 5/10.\n  \nLT/RT - Hopefully we can get Steele on another Collins-esque contract (pre departure). If not, I can see them moving Tyron to RT and putting Tyler at LT making IOL the play here. Tyler has all the tools to be a dominant LT for us ala Tyron, probably even better.  \n  \nEDGE/DL - We need run stuffers, no other way around it.  \n\nCB - Should be a 15/10. Diggs is a ball-hawk and can only do so much. People crap on Brown but he was doing what he needed. Then he got injured and we got exposed.  \n  \nS - I think this is more of an issue than a lot of people think. Dan Quinn is most likely on his way out, most of his safeties are his type of guys.

He showed this season when called on that he likely won\u2019t ever live up to his potential.\nRookie Bland faired well when filling in for inj Lewis, & he could kick outside now w/ lewis return.\nThe rest of the roster is at best upside depth.\n\u2026 A 1st rd talent would fit well & if not, a day 2 starter is needed.\n\nS - 7/10, Wilson is a FA & likely to draw a big deal elsewhere.  Hooker & Kearse are solid, but a 3rd is needed to keep Kearse in his big nickel / rover role.  However, w/ all the other needs, will likely be a vet FA spot holder & possibly a day 3 upside player.\n\nI foresee CB & WR as our top priority & then falling value / best available at one of the T-DE-RB-DT-LB."

In a world where the relevant QBs are gone, Carolina takes the best offensive player on the board.  \n\n\nNo.12) I know that WR is typically the consensus pick here, and while I would love a Addision+Young connection, I think the Texans are better off taking BPA and going WR later (or in FA).  \n\n\nNo.18) Is a starting Safety a position of need? No. However, Branch is clearly my BPA, and the Lions need defensive talent. The 4-2-5 scheme helps sell this a bit more as well.

If he's there, they're going to get him. \n\nBijan Robinson, I see what you're getting at, but I really don't see that happening. If Stroud or a Bears trade is available without massive overpayment the Panthers are making a move.",
        "Jax doesn\u2019t need OTs. \n\nOur most pressing need is DB and TE. Later in the draft we\u2019ll probably pick up interior OL and DL.",
        "For Atlanta, we\u2019re not in a place to take a project QB with a top 10 pick as Ridder is coming off a 2-2 record as a rookie, and will be given more opportunities next year while they work through filling needs through free agency and the draft. \n\nAtlanta had the opportunity to draft project QBs last year and instead went with a guy who had 48 starts in college. He may not be the guy, but the front office wouldn\u2019t drop what they have at the moment for a what if",
        "I don't mind Ringo but he's looked shaky against some teams  this year. I'd be okay if the Steelers got him in the second, however, he seems like a project type player and we need someone that can come in day 1 to start as CB1, whether that's FA or draft.",
        "Ah yes, the thing the Broncos need to improve more than anything else is clearly a CB and not literally anything else on offense. Makes sense.",
        "Chicago isn't staying at #1. Think they trade back, but if Indy really loves Levis as much as the rumors, Indy could stick at 4 and still get him. Someone likes Bryce enough to try and leapfrog Houston, so what Houston does will be very telling. Do they trade up with Chicago preemptively? Not this early, but wouldn't be shocked to see it after the combine."

While they certainly could pick a corner, and it wouldn't be a bad idea, the real problem was how poor their iLB and slot corner were in coverage.

The Commander's pick is a head scratcher, we just drafted a running back who played really damn well. That being said, you have a run on CBs earlier than I would anticipate, so that may have been a pick out of 'best player available' handbook.",

      "body": "**1.01 | Bears: Will Anderson Jr., Edge, Alabama**\r  \nIn all honesty, I fully expect the Bears to trade this pick to either the Colts or Panthers. I highly doubt they stay on the clock or take a quarterback. Justin Fields has shown enough to earn another year of trying to establish himself as the franchise quarterback. But, if the Bears do stay here, I'd fully expect them to draft Will Anderson Jr. He's by far the best pass-rusher and run-defender in the draft. Over his last two seasons, he has 27.5 sacks and 48 tackles for loss. If the Bears do trade this pick, Will Anderson will be selected by the Cardinals at No.3 overall. Either way, Anderson has all the talent to be the next Micah Parsons in the NFL.\r  \n\r  \n**1.02 | Texans: Bryce Young, Quarterback, Alabama**\r  \nIf the Bears trade the No.1 overall pick, either Young or Levis will be selected No.1 overall. Young's a former Heisman winner who has proven that he can play quarterback despite his smaller stature. He put on display his excellent instincts, arm, accuracy, and pocket presence that one wants from a franchise quarterback. He would become the Texans' future and give them their next long-term quarterback after three seasons of awful quarterback play. He's got enough mobility to be a threat with his legs too which is a need in this current NFL-world. Young will likely be the No.1 quarterback taken.\r  \n\r  \n**1.03 | Cardinals: Jalen Carter, Defensive Line, Georgia**\r  \nAs mentioned above, the Cardinals highly likely will take Anderson and be set at the edge position for many years. However, if the Bears don't trade their pick, the Cardinals very well might or they'll take the next dominant defensive player in the draft in Carter. Carter's very young but has been one of the focal parts of Georgia's potent defense for the past couple of years. He's able to shed through blocks and consistently get into the offensive backfield. Don't be surprised to see him off the board in the top-five picks as Carter has game-changing talent from the interior defensive line.\r  \n\r  \n**1.04 | Colts: C.J. Stroud, Quarterback, Ohio State**\r  \nIf the Colts stay put, they'll likely wind up with either Stroud or Levis. I do think it's a bit of a coin flip right now as to who they'll go with. So, I'll go with the quarterback I currently think is better right now which is Stroud. We saw him light up the scoreboard against the top defense in college football in the college football playoffs. He's got an accurate arm, excellent pocket movement, and can read a defense. Plus, he proved that he's got more than enough wheels to escape a collapsing pocket and gain some yards on the ground. I have zero worries right now with Stroud's ability to be an NFL quarterback.\n\n**1.05 | Seahawks via Broncos: Tyree Wilson, Edge, Texas Tech**\r  \nThere's no hiding the fact that Seattle needs a lot of help with their defense. They get some with Wilson who will immediately be their best pass-rusher. Wilson is a powerful pass-rusher who's versatile. He'll fit right in with the tough-nosed Seahawks and will be relentless in chasing after the quarterback. Don't forget that while the offense is needed to win, defense is still what wins the Championship. The Seahawks will have to continue building the next Legion of Boom.\r  \n\r  \n**1.06 | Lions via Rams: Bryan Bresee, Defensive Line, Clemson**\r  \nThe Lions need help defending the run. They got a lot better at defending the pass and in pass-rushing. However, teams could still run all over the Lions. Bresee will help a lot in that department serving as an impact defensive lineman for them. While he might have some injury history, if he's healthy, he's an elite defender. Bryan can clog up running lanes allowing the Lions to swarm to the ball. This is a pick that will set their defense up nicely for next year's playoff chase.\r  \n\r  \n**1.07 | Raiders: Paris Johnson Jr., Offensive Tackle, Ohio State**\r  \nThe word on the street is that the Raiders are the favorite for Tom Brady's next team. If that happens, then the Raiders will have to shift from long-term priorities to win-now short-term priorities like beefing up the offensive line to give Brady or their quarterback time to throw the ball. Something they failed to do for Derek Carr. That's where Johnson comes in as the top tackle in the draft. He's a giant man yet moves like a nimble small athlete. I love his ability to stand tall and use his length to stop pass-rushers. The Raiders are in need of impact help along their offensive line and this certainly helps.\n\n[See the Full Mock Draft Here](https://fantasydata.com/2023-nfl-mock-draft-1)",

        "I'm not disparaging the pick but saying Tyree Wilson would immediately become the Seahawks best pass rusher is pretty bonkers. Uchenna Nwosu and Darell Taylor each had 9.5 sacks this year. No chance he comes in and instantly becomes their best pass rusher as a 3-4 DE.",
        "Nolan Smith is too small to be an effective 4-3 edge. He\u2019s listed at 235 and would need to add 30 lbs to get to a more typical 4-3 size.

CHI via IND- EDGE Will Anderson. \nCHI trades back, gains some nice picks and still gets the BP in the draft.  \n\n5. SEA- DL Jalen Carter. \nA thin SEA D gets thick in the middle as Pete believes he can get the best out of the young hoss.  \n\n6. DET- CB Devon Witherspoon.  \nWith all the weapons in place, DET begins to address that Hawaiaan blue defense.  \n\n7. OAK- QB Will Levis. \nThis pick could very well end up being Paris if OAK lands Brady as a FA but for now, we'll call it Levis.  \n\n8.

TEN- WR Quentin Johnston. \nTEN knows they need more on O than just Henry and Treylons fragility leads them to picking this very sturdy WR. \n\n12. HOU- WR Jaxson Smith Njigba. \nHOU grabs a dance partner for their new franchise qb. \n\n13. NYJ- OL Paris Johnson Jr.  \nWith a good d in place, good wrs and capable rbs, NYJ opts for the best avail OL to help keep their new qb Aaron Roger's clean.  \n\n14. NE- EDGE Lukas Van Ness. \nFighting his urge to take a guard from a D3 school with his 1st pick, Belichek opts for a position of need and a guy that already feels like a Patriot.  \n\n15. GB- TE Michael Mayer. \nMayer marks the beginning of a long-standing tradition of GB drafting 1st round receivers for their pro bowl qb Jordan Love. \n\n16. WFT- DL Brian Breesee. \nWFT decides not to get too cute and takes the BPA on their board. \n\n17. PITT- CB Christian Gonzalez. \nA very drunk PITT fan tweets anger about PITT not taking Porter here to Tomlin to which Tomlin replies, \"fuck off im trying to work here.\"  \n\n18. DET- DL Siaki Ika. \nAfter getting pushed around by Carolinas Oline this year DET opts for the DL man mountain that should help keep their undersized LBs clean.  \n\n19. TB- S Brian Branch. \nTB begins the great reboot after tearing down their team when Brady leaves for Tenn.  \n\n20. SEA- CB Joey Porter Jr. \nIn one round SEA Gloria Estefans their entire defense and turns the beat around.  \n\n21.  LAC- T Anton Harrison. \nLAC quite simply fills a position of need.  \n\n22. BAL- WR Jordan Addison. \nNo secret BAL needs WR and they take the layup here to keep Lamar happy. \n\n23. MINN- CB Cam Smith. \nAn absolute dog shit defense gets slightly less dog shittier.  \n\n24. JAX- G OCyrus Torrence. \nSemi local young man helps keep TLAW upright in Duval Country. \n\n25. NYG- WR Zay Flowers. \nA weaponless team adds a much needed weapon. \n\n26. DAL- LB Trenton Simspon. \nDAL hit a grand slam with Parsons so why not go back to the linebacker well?  \n\n27. BUF- DL Calijah Kancey. \nAfter being pushed around by a 2nd string Cincy Oline in the playoffs, Buf decides to do something about it.  \n\n28. CIN- OL Broderick Jones. \nWhile Cincy could use some secondary help, protecc Joe Burrow at all costs isn't just a mantra, it's a draft way of life. \n\n29. DEN- WR Josh Downs. \nFor better or worse DEN is stuck with Russ so give him help since Sutton appears to be a shell of himself.  \n\n30. KC- RB Bijan Robinson. \nThe pick is made and everyone cries into the darkness, \"how did we let Mahomes get Bijan?\"  \n\n31.

Stroud. (Possibly on draft day and only IF the Texans pass on him for Will Anderson.)\n\n-Rodgers traded to the Colts. Indy then spends a lot of resources on offense through the draft and FA. \n\n-Lamar to the Raiders is like\u2026 50/50 for me. Ravens could outright franchise him, of course. Tampa/Miami could be hometown destinations too depending on what happens with Tua/Brady. I think of the two Miami would win and I\u2019m sure Lamar would want to go to a place without state tax and Miami has more on offense.

      "body": "I'm going to try to do a Patriots-only mock more frequently. Want to get more into the draft this year than in years prior.\n\nI'll use the PFF Mock Simulator because it's best with trades, even though it's frustrating not being able to see the board change as picks are made. I also do not use the default settings; I slow down pick speed and crank up randomness to one notch below maximum because, let's be honest, the draft never goes in the order that anyone predicts.\n\n(Obviously compensatory picks are projected at this point and not official.)\n\n(I immediately notice that PFF lists the Patriots' most pressing need as QB. Given that Mac Jones was placed under a coaching situation where no QB could have succeeded, I'm immediately offended.)\n\n(Anyway:)\n\n**TRADE: PIT trades 1-17, 3-80, 7-233, and a 2024 4th to NE for 1-14**\n\nThe Patriots' most pressing need is tackle, and there are two whom I could see them taking this early still available in Broderick Jones and and Anton Harrison. Jaxon Smith-Njigba, whom I would also consider taking in the first, is available too. But I can move down a few picks and still get one of the tackles - I suspect Pittsburgh is going to take the other - and I'd like to grab some more picks.\n\n**TRADE: NYG trades 1-25, 2-57, and a 2024 4th to NE for 1-17**\n\nWell Pittsburgh didn't take a tackle, so my guys are still there. More picks please.\n\n**1-25: Broderick Jones, T, Georgia**\n\nThis pick seems likely given the new New England scouting department's propensity to target players with high athleticism. My other two considerations went off the board (Smith-Njigba at 18 to DET, Harrison at 24 to JAX) so this is a no-brainer selection; Jones can start at left tackle long-term, even if he spends a year learning behind Trent Brown (a player I question if will be a Patriot in 2023). I know who I'm targeting in the second round, and with two seconds I'm going to look for an opportunity to move up.\n\n**TRADE: NE trades 2-46, 4-117, and 7-230 to CLE for 2-42 and 4-126**\n\nThere haven't been many offensive linemen coming off the board and the Jets still need a tackle, having filled their most pressing need in the first by selecting Bryce Young. I hop one spot ahead of them to take:\n\n**2-42: Darnell Wright, T, Tennesee**\n\nThe Patriots need two long-term starting tackles after their exterior offensive line fell apart in 2022. Wright has experience on both sides of the line and, with Jones on the left side, can step in at right tackle immediately.\n\n**2-57: Darnell Washington, TE, Georgia**\n\nI didn't trade down here because no teams were interested, but the Patriots are in need of tight end help after Jonnu Smith and Hunter Henry (both under contract in 2023) underwhelmed dramatically in 2022. I picked Washington over Dalton Kincaid despite the latter's athleticism primarily for Washington's size and ability to use that size as both a pass catcher and a blocker. Additionally, I wanted to corner the market on Darnells.\n\n**3-76: Ronnie Hickman, S, Ohio State**\n\nWith Devin McCourty's potential retirement, the Patriots could use a replacement at free safety. Hickman has safety versatility the Patriots love, comfort playing in the box or deep, and capability against the run and pass.\n\n**3-80: Keondre Coburn, DL, Texas**\n\nDespite the Patriots' strong defense, their interior proved underwhelming against the run and pass, hampered by Christian Barmore's missing time. Coburn is not only one of the largest players in this year's draft class, but a player who can generate pressure (28 total pressures in 2022) in the pass game rather than playing as only an obstacle against the run.\n\n**3-97: Isaiah McGuire, ED, Missouri**\n\nPFF doesn't offer many trades, which sucks, because I wanted to move down here. But the Patriots need edge talent beyond Matthew Judon and Josh Uche, and McGuire has the size, athleticism, and versatility to make an impact in the Patriots' defensive front.\n\n**4-107: Andrei Iosivas, WR, Princeton**\n\nRemember what I said about the Patriots drafting extremely athletic players? That'd be Iosivas. My concern with his limited tape is I didn't see a lot of separation, which is something pretty much every WR on their roster lacks, but this is a mock so I'm going to go for it.\n\n**4-126: Kyu Blu Kelly, CB, Stanford**\n\nThe Patriots have a lot of small corners; Kelly is a bit more sizable at 6'1\" and has shown stickiness at times.\n\n**6-190: Israel Abanikanda, RB, Pitt**\n\nPats are good at RB but it's worth taking a late-round flyer on a back with burst and pass-catching versatility.\n\n**6-211: Aubrey Miller Jr., LB, Jackson State**\n\nPats need LB help (wanted Noah Sewell earlier but he went before I had a chance to trade up for him) so I'll take Miller. I don't know much about him.\n\n**7-233: Ethan Evans, P, Wingate**\n\nWith Jake Bailey's status uncertain due to his suspension possibly negating the guaranteed money in his contract, the Pats might very well dip into the punting well.\n\n...this took longer than I thought. Anyway, here's my attempt #1.",

If the cardinals are staying put to guarantee they also get one of those two, then as long as the colts have two QBs they like and don\u2019t have one miles ahead at the other, then they have no reason to give up a haul to trade up to 1 because the bears won\u2019t trade down with anyone later.

The Bills needed (and still need!) a power running back who can gut out tough runs and be the center of the running game. James Cook is not that, and Georgia never used him as that. Bijan Robinson will be both a top tier receiving back as well as a focal point of the running game. In my opinion, it's a no brainer for the Bills to take if he falls to them, even if there are bigger holes on the roster. A strong running game to balance the passing game and keep it so that Allen doesn't have to run as much will give the Bills some much-needed life."

He\u2019ll improve their run blocking and give Allen a solid target. The TEs in this final four are Kelce, Kittle, Goedert and Hurst (who overall has not been what people were hoping for but he\u2019s had two very good playoff games). Knox is a good TE and you could decide to upgrade elsewhere but I think Washington improves both elements of their offense.\n\nYou could look at the RBs too and realize they could stand to improve there- McCaffrey, Mixon, Sanders are all very good backs and it\u2019s not like the Chiefs didn\u2019t just try to get better there by taking a first round RB. Etienne taking the starting job for the Jags improved them too. NFL GMs value top RBs more than Redditors do.\n\nThere is some over stating the Bills problems. They had the number two scoring offense and the number two scoring defense this year. There\u2019s several spots they could upgrade - RB, WR2/3, the OL, the secondary but they\u2019re not far off so there\u2019s going to be a lot of different players mocked to Buffalo and a RB at the level of Robison is one of them.",

      "body": "Tua's health is a huge question mark. I believe Garrapolo goes to Miami to be a starter in Tua's absence in 2023 as Mike McDaniel was the 49ers pass coordinator before becoming a HC. Jets don't get Rodgers. Rodgers ways will not mix well with New York and the young talent they have. I don't see Joe Douglas making that move especially with so much left on his contract. Derek Carr makes the most sense for the Jets. If Carr is not all out released and traded, the Jets will only have to give up a conditional pick. The Jets have a lot of young talent and a 32 year old Carr would fit betterthan a 40 year old Rodgers. Jordan Love gets traded I believe. Titans part ways with Tannehill as they are 23 million over the cap in 2023. Malik Willis could be the guy along with a B- backup like a Taylor Heinecke. Mac Jones will be slated to be the starter but they will bring in a veteran to backup/compete. A name that could fit well is Jacoby Brisset. Sam Darnold will be in demand and I even expect to hear his name blurbed with the Jets but only to drive up his asking price from the Panthers. Darnold is a toss up but he does end up back in Carolina as there's a real lack of options for him. Plus, if Brady leaves TB Darnold becomes the best QB in that division. Speaking of Brady, the Brady to Las Vegas show could be a thing. Brady and McDaniels worked well together and Brady would have a good supporting cast with Adams and Renfrow. Plus with an early first round pick, they could add more talent. The Saints are in cap hell as they almost 60 million over the cap for 2023 and parting ways with Winston may not save them enough to do so. Either way, the Saints will likely end up with some bargain basement QB like a Mike White. Seahawks own the draft this year as the 5th pick could be a place to get one of the top 3 QBs (Young, Stroud, Levis) in the draft. \n\nI predict 5 QBs will go in the Draft. Young, Stroud and Levis go in the top 7 (a trade up or two) and Richardson goes mid round (Washington in he falls) and Tanner McKee goes late possibly to Minnesota as they prepare for their future or someone trades into the first. Atlanta intrigues me as I can see them trading up to get a top 3 QB (trade with Seattle or Arizona). They have talent on offense with London and Pitts as well as over 50 million in cap room to add more. It's an intriguing scenario.",

Bradbury was coming off his 3rd year of struggling at center, we had no starting LT, and RG was a turnstile. \n\nI was pumped when we traded back and still landed Darrisaw and when the 3rd round rolled around and we had 4 picks I was jumping out of my seat at the possibility of landing Meinerz AND Smith.\n\nThen we drafted Wyatt fucking Davis. \n\nDay 3 I\u2019m pounding the table for Trey Smith since we now have a G and LT coming off injury. Ok, Smith is the perfect insurance plan. Played LT as a freshman before moving inside to guard. \n\nNo dice. \n\n2022 Vikings draft Ed Ingram who led the league in pressures allowed and just looked lost on a weekly basis. \n\nNow we\u2019re going into 2023 and both guard spots could stand to be upgraded and center is probably leaving in FA. \n\nThe 2021 3rd round is forever to me the chance we missed to fix the OL long term. Thanks for reading my rant. \n\nWhat\u2019s your team and their mistake?",

And Dayo Odeyingbo was selected in 2021 coming off an achilles injury at 54, played 10 games last year and in every game this year. He just looks kind of fat and slow but does seem pretty strong. He had 5 sacks this year which isn't bad for a year 2 player I suppose. We also selected Parris Campbell at 59 overall in 2019, and he was basically injured his entire first 3 years almost, but he did have a pretty decent season this year so its kind of unfair to consider someone who was injury prone to be a \"draft mistake\". The main issue people have with Campbell is that DK Metcalf was selected just a few picks later at the same position. Other than that, Ballard has been pretty exceptional at drafting. The only main issues with him is failure at the QB position and not being able to get production from the edge position"

He Was just cursed by some voodoo where his bones were made of glass as soon as he was drafted.  That one's more a miss due to freak injury.\n\nShea Mcleillen is the first round pick of the last decade that will always make me the most angry.  He was drafted a round early and wasn't a fit at all for our defense.  What made it worse is there were 2 players drafted behind him who were much better fits, Chandler Jones and Whitney mercilus.  Jones is still playing, Mercilus had a great career that just ended last year.  Shea pick never made sense and I still don't understand it.",

I could name a whole bunch of worse first round picks by the Bears. \n\nWant to start with a receiver? David Terrell. \n\nBut we could also go:\nCedric Benson\nCurtis Enis\nGabe Carimi\nCade McNown\nMichael Haynes\nAnd the OT from Vanderbilt (name escapes me)\n\nAll were worse picks because they had red flags or were way over drafted. \n\nThe worst in my book was Enis. Joe Paterno supposedly warned teams he was a head case but we picked him at five anyway. Rumors of Randy Moss smoking pot was just too risky, but a guy\u2019s college coach saying a guy was a head case? We\u2019ll take our chances.

  "selftext": "Ayy another year more mocks. with TDN finally getting their MDM up i figured its time to make my first \"official\" mock.\n\nThis mock is a combination of what i would do and what i think is going to happen, as is shown by the mid-first position of Levis.\n\nMy mocks are usually hated on pretty hard, I'm not sure any of them have had positive upvotes in the past, but hey I'm just here to provide my take so i can say i told you so in the future, or ask what the hell i was thinking.\n\nThe trades and picks are analyzed seperately.\n\nPlease provide feedback, so i can get a better feel for who wants what for mock 2.0\n\n \n\n**Trade 1:**\n\nBears Receive: 1.4, 2.35, 2024 1st\n\nColts Receive: 1.1, 5.149\n\nThe colts need to finally get their QB. Next years first and this years second is enough to get there and ensure that no other teams trade infront of them. This is a tough trade to make but the colts have a good roster and hopefully their new QB can have enough of an immediate impact to devalue next year's pick.\n\nThe bears take the best option available and still can be there for one of the \u201cbig 4\u201d ( Young, Stroud, Anderson, Carter) to either draft or trade down again. Looks like everything's turning up bears.\n\n**Trade 2:**\n\nPatriots Receive: 1.19, 3.83. \n\nBuccaneers Receive: 1.14\n\nThe Bucs need to try to get a QB of the future. One of the top ones is falling and it is not a high price to pay for a possible franchise QB.\n\nThe pats don\u2019t really have a good choice here, and the choices they could make are all kinda reaches, not that the patriots are averse to reaching, but this is what I would do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1. **(Trade 1) Indianapolis Colts- Bryce Young, QB, Alabama**\n\nThe early talk is that this is will levis. And if it is i\u2019m sorry colts fans. But i\u2019m not going to let the talk affect me yet. Young is the best qb in the class and the height problems are overblown as people look for something to criticize. Don\u2019t overthink this and just take the best qb available.\n\n2.    **Houston Texans- C.J Stroud, QB, Ohio State**\n\nThe Texans got screwed by Lovie Smiths revenge game, but stroud is still a very good prospect. I have worries and like all qb prospects i would sit him for a year, but that doesn\u2019t really happen as much as it should. Stroud is the best qb available and he can have a year or 2 of rebuilding to work out the kinks in his play.\n\n3.     **Arizona Cardinals- Will Anderson Jr., Edge, Alabama**\n\nThe Cards take one of the big 2 defenders and don\u2019t really have to think about it too hard. Anderson is a great prospect and should make immediate and long term impact. This could also be carter and i wouldn\u2019t really complain. I take anderson just due to the rising positional value of Edge rushers and the constant availability of middle-of-the-road DLs\n\n4.     **(Trade 1) Chicago Bears- Jalen Carter, DL, Georgia**\n\nTrade down works out perfectly for the bears as they get an instant plug-and-play DL that can anchor the bears DL for years to come. A no-brainer game changer that the bears can build around in free agency and future drafts.\n\n5.   **Seattle Seahawks- Tyree Wilson, Edge,  Texas Tech**\n\nTyree Wilson seems to be the consensus Edge 2, and i can\u2019t really complain. He is big and has looked good at texas tech. He is 6\u20196 and should be able to get pressure on the qb that the seahawks have been lacking. He could also take eyes off of mafe and allow him to improve. If all goes well the seahawks could have a very good EDGE tandem for the foreseeable future. Pair this with their extraordinary CB class last year and the hawks could be building a scary defense.\n\n6.     **Detroit Lions- Christian Gonzalez, CB, Oregon**\n\nGonzalez is my CB1 and should be able to make a quick difference. He wil be a big difference from Amani Oruwariye, although his name is not nearly as fun to say. There are certainly other positions that the lions could take but none of them have a player of this level available.\n\n7.     **Las Vegas Raiders- Paris Johnson Jr., OT, Ohio State**\n\nDaaa raidaaas need OT and Johnson is my #1. I say that because he is everyone elses number 1 and i have seen him mocked to the raiders before. I\u2019m not going to watch any film on OT\u2019s i would rather mock will levis at 1. Johnson is bigger than Skoronski and based off the games i have watched seems better. Raiders get an OT that they can protect whatever qb they get next year with.\n\n8.      **Atlanta Falcons- Myles Murphy, Edge, Clemson**\n\nMurphy is the biggest difference maker available. Falcons take someone who can hopefully put pressure on opposing qbs and allow the falcons young CB group to not have to work as hard.\n\n9.     **Carolina Panthers- Anthony Richardson, QB, Florida**\n\nOk. yes I\u2019m sorry. Please stop yelling at me. This pick comes with another move: Bridge QB. Again I\u2019m sorry. Richardson has elite tools, his biggest issue is accuracy, however in games I have watched this issue seems to mostly disappear, cite LSU 2022. This leads me to believe that with some good coaching the accuracy issues can disappear. I feel that with a year to sit behind a solid vet qb he can figure out most of the accuracy issues and get used to the scheme, leading to improved decision making. Using this season to work out young players and find the best plan going forward. Richardson can become a leader in year 2 and i feel can become one of the best qbs in football. Carolina is not my favorite landing spot for richardson, but i feel that the panthers want a franchise qb enough to try to become that perfect landing space, starting with signing a mentor qb. I\u2019m not going to name any because that will make panthers fans even more upset with me. Again, I\u2019m sorry, but i believe this is the best way to build the team going forward and is what i would do if i was gm. (cue \u201cwell good thing you\u2019re not a gm\u201d comments).\n\n10.     **Philidelphia Eagles- Devon Witherspoon, CB, Illinois**\n\nWitherspoon has been a favorite of mine for quite some time, and as a vikings fan i am disappointed that the has been rising as much as he has. He\u2019s my CB2 and Its unfair that the eagles get him. I see him as kinda gonzalez lite, which is not a bad thing to be. He can be lower in the depth chart and have time to adjust to the NFL. They could also go edge here but witherspoon is a better CB than any remaining edges are edges.\n\n11.     **Tennessee Titans- Jordan Addison, WR, USC**\n\nThe recent addison fall is kinda wild to me. Addison repeatedly amazed me while watching film and was seemingly always open. He is easily the best route runner in this class and reminds me of diggs. His main knock is catching, which honestly hasn\u2019t shown up as much as an issue in the games i have watched. He is easily my WR1 and OT is the normal pick here, but skorinskis size worries me a bit and addison is probably my favorite prospect in this draft. BPA wins out here between the 2 big titans needs. If i was a betting man i would assume skoronski goes here though, which is not a bad pick.\n\n12.     **Houston Texans- Quentin Johnston, WR, TCU**\n\nThe texans are my favorite team in terms of possible draft class this year. They land themselves directly in QB1 and WR1 territory. A team with a solid OL, good young RB, and weapons like cooks and Johnston is kind of a dream situation for a young QB. Johnston is big and fast and fast and big. He isn\u2019t my favorite prospect but he would pair perfectly with a shorter route runner in cooks and provide stroud with a great first year offense. Draft some later round WRs to sure up the wr core over the next few years and focus hard on Defense over FA and next draft and the texans could find themselves competing sooner than they expect. If alot goes right (and i mean alot) they could even find themselves fighting for a wildcard spot as soon as next year.\n\n13.     **New York Jets- Peter Skoronski, OT, Northwestern**\n\nJets need OL, Jets take OL. I am not drafting sam darnold 3.0 to the jets, they have \n\nbeen through this too many times. Run with white for another year while building an offense for a qb they draft next year.\n\n14.     **(Trade 2) Tampa Bay Buccaneers- Will Levis, QB, Kentucky**\n\nI do not like will levis (as a prospect) he is unable to sense and adapt to pressure, often makes bad decisions, and is 24 years old, if i am an NFL gm i am not even thinking about him until late round 2. That being said, he has some of the best mechanics a qb can have while having some of the best size a qb can have. The physical tools are there and he has shown flashes of elite decision making and play reading. This pick will change alot as we get closer to the draft, but as it sits Levis is the best qb available and the bucs need qb. If the bucs like levis- a big if- i find it very reasonable for them to make the trade losing just a third for a guy that they could turn into a franchise qb.\n\n15.     **Green Bay Packers- Lukas Van Ness, EDGE- Iowa**\n\nThe packers are always in the talks for an edge rusher. I don\u2019t know much about Van Ness, but he was mocked at 8 by DJ, so i will put him here for now. The packers defense has been dissapointing and as long as none of the top 2 WRs are available i don\u2019t really see any other pick to be made here (aside from a different EDGE if you want.)\n\n16.     **Washington Commanders- Joey Porter Jr., CB, Penn State**\n\nThe commies need CB. porter is my CB3. Bing bang boom.\n\n17.     **Pittsburgh Steelers- Broderick Jones, OT, Georgia**\n\nThe steelers need OL. Jones is the best available. He should be able to fit in here without much problem and allow pickett some more time.\n\n18.     **Detroit Lions- Bryan Bresee- DL, Clemson**\n\nBresee seems to be kinda controversial as he can be ranked up in the single digits and down in the 30s. With the lions good Edge tandem and growing cb group i would take bresee here to make the lions DL a true force for opposing OLs. I also thought about brian branch, but i figured that bresee would make more of an impact \n\n19.     **(Trade 2) New England Patriots- JSN, WR, Ohio State**\n\nThis is not a patriots pick, but the pats need WR and JSN is underrated. He looked great 2 years ago and had been battling injuries during 2022. Jsn is a great route runner and should be able to add a true weapon to the pats offense. Hopefully they can figure out qb though.\n\n20.     **Seattle Seahawks- Brian Branch, S, Alabama**\n\nBranch has been a slow but sure riser over the past few weeks and i don\u2019t see a reason to stop. They still have a solid offense and additions over the top and in the trenches on defense should be able to make the seahawks defense another good one to keep eyes on.\n\n21.     **Miami Dolphins- Tom Brady, QB, Not The Dolphins**\n\nRuh roh\n\n22.     **LA Chargers- Dawand Jones, OT, Ohio State**\n\nThe chargers get an OT to protect herbert. The real problem is gameplanning and play calling, but a solid OL is always a good pick and i don\u2019t see a WR that i would take over jones\n\n23.     **Baltimore Ravens- Clark Phillips III, CB, Utah**\n\nThe ravens need CB or WR, and like the chargers and vikings there isnt really any wr that i like enough to take over the remaining top players at their positions\n\n24.     **Minnesota Vikings- Trenton Simpson, LB, Clemson**\n\nI need to start this off by saying that i am a die-hard vikings fan i have been through our troubles all my life and have a full understanding of where our roster stands. Right now we are in talks for CB and WR, along with the occasional QB. Looking at who is available there is nobody i would take above simpson for this team. Our CB group is not an empty room, it is a bunch of middle of the road cbs that we hope can develop, and i want to allow a year to do that. We have dantzler, Booth Jr, Shelley, Evans, along with P2 to coach them up. I see no reason to add another developmental CB to this mix. Ringo is a boom or bust prospect that does not stand out to me as an instant improvement to anybody we have now, and would just be another addition to our developing CB room, which i do not believe is worth more than simpson. As for WR, i do not see any WR on the board that i would truly feel good about drafting at this spot. Hyatt is fas but based on the film that i have watched he needs to work on his route running and will probably slot in as a wr 3 or 4 for this year, where hopefully he can improve with our scheme. I like hyatt here, but not as much as simpson. This is mostly due to how often late round WRs are able to become top WRs. i would rather take a speedy wr later in the draft, who can likely contribute similarly to how hyatt would this year. As for josh downs, he is small and does not show much on film. If any of the top 3 WRs are here, i am taking them. If any of the top 4 CBs are here, i am taking them. If richardson is here, i am taking him. But they are not here. Simpson is a top talent at his position in this draft and fits in at a rarely talked about hole in the vikings defense. Hicks and Kendricks have shown to be slow and not good over this last year, and with their contracts and a new DC i expect them to be on their way out. I love Asamoah and Simpson could fit in as His LB partner, which is a group i think a DC would love to work with over 2 aging slow LBs. Simpson is a solid player, which i do not feel is available at any other position the vikings need. I do not hate taking hyatt here, but if i am in the draft room i am taking simpson.\n\n25.     **Jacksonville Jagwagers- Anton Harrison, OT, Oklahoma**\n\nThe jagwagers ignored OT by taking walker last year, they fill that hole here and finish off a scary offense next year consisting of kirk, ridley, engram, and etienne\n\n26.     **New York Giants- Jalin Hyatt, WR, Tennesee**\n\nHyatt is fast and the Giants are in bad need for wr. I feel that daboll will be able to cook up some routes to stretch the field and add some variance to the giants offence.\n\n27.     **Dallas Cowboys- Kelee Ringo, CB, Georgia**\n\nRingo is a boom or bust prospect, but luckily he doesn\u2019t have to make an impact right away. He can take time and be a secondary piece in an elite defense.\n\n28.     **Cincinatti bengals- Cam Smith, CB, Carolina**\n\nSmith is very good prospect but he isn\u2019t really elite. He gets similar treatment to Ringo and doesn\u2019t have to be elite right away\n\n29.     **Denver Broncos- Isaiah Foskey, Edge, Notre Dame**\n\nNo more chubb, and a lack of top end OTs available. Foskey can fit in and be used to keep the broncos defense one of the best in the league\n\n30.     **Buffalo Bills- Bijan Robinson, RB, Texas**\n\nSomeones gotta do it. Look at how much of a difference saquon makes on the giants, now pair that with the bills elite passing offense. An instant game changer that can make the bills impossible to gameplan for.\n\n31.     **KC Chiefs- Rashee Rice, WR, SMU**\n\nBest Wr available. Give mahomes whatever he wants.\n\n32.     **Philidelphia Eagles- Derick Hall, EDGE, Auburn**\n\nEagles finish another elite draft by addressing their other need. Like witherspoon he doesn\u2019t have to be elite right away and can be there when needed. I also thought about John michael schmitz but i don\u2019t want to replace kelce until he makes it clear he is done. Also rowtheboatskiumahgogophers.",

Stronski probably projects as a swing and that makes more sense as he could play LG and or backup LT. RT is where the team is deficient, but I haven\u2019t seen many high grades ones for this class yet.

I know both were ranked as receiver prospects to watch coming into the season, but really dropped as the season went on.  Demus is understandable, but I don't know what happened with Jarrett.  \n\nHowever, this draft has so many interesting slot wide receivers that are outside of the Packer's standard measurements.  I'm absolutely in love with both Zay Flowers and Josh Downs in this class, but I doubt we look at either.  JSN is also a pipe dream.  I know a lot of people are down on him, but I still think he has stud potential, especially as a intelligent, route running slot player.",

I like his hands, his speed and agility are unreal, and even though he\u2019s small he\u2019s not shy about contact so hopefully he could at least be a stalk blocker in the run game. \n\nJarrett is a guy I think just got pushed down because there\u2019s a lot of other similar slot types and he\u2019s got a bit of drop issues. I think he\u2019s definitely worth considering for us day 3 though. \n\nOver all I think the Packers need to prioritize TE, S, DL, and Edge over WR, so I personally want us to either trade back to acquire more capital to make it a little more comfortable using a higher pick on a Slot WR, or we should just look more around day 3 if we\u2019re not gonna get one of the first round guys.

  "selftext": "  \n\n**2023 NFL MOCK DRAFT 1.0**\n\n1. CHICAGO BEARS: WILL ANDERSON ALABAMA EDGE \n\nThe Bears would be wise to see if they could trade down, they need as many picks as they can get. If they do not get the offer they want,  drafting the best overall player and pass rusher Will Anderson after rookie safety Jaquan Brisker led the team in sacks in 2022 would be a good move. \n\n2. HOUSTON TEXANS: BRYCE YOUNG ALABAMA QB\n\nThe quarterback should be the pick the question is which one will the Texans prefer. I think it\u2019s between Stroud and Young who are the most pro-ready at this point, but I expect them to go young and not the veteran route. \n\n3. ARIZONA CARDINALS: JALEN CARTER GEORGIA DL\n\nThe Cardinals will be losing J.J. Watt to retirement and Zach Allen will be a free agent. This choice lines up well with need and value. \n\n4. INDIANAPOLIS COLTS:    C.J. STROUD OHIO STATE QB\n\nEver since Luck retired the Colts have been finding short-term solutions for Quarterback. This year it backfired and the new regime will look to address Quarterback in the draft. \n\n5. CAROLINA PANTHERS TRADE VIA SEATTLE: WILL LEVIS KENTUCKY QB\n\nThe Panthers are going to be interested in addressing Quarterback. Will Levis is a high-ceiling player that has intriguing physical tools to work with.\n\n6. DETROIT LIONS: CHRISTIAN GONZALEZ OREGON CB\n\nBrad Holmes has done a great job in his first two seasons drafting talent. Penei Sewell, Aidan Hutchinson, and Jameson Williams were their first-round picks in 21-22. Gonzalez is good value and addresses a team need. \n\n7. LAS VEGAS RAIDERS: BRYAN BRESEE CLEMSON DL\n\nAnthony Richardson is still available, but Raiders need talent all over the place, especially on the interior defensive line. \n\n8. ATLANTA FALCONS: BIJAN ROBINSON TEXAS RB \n\nThis will be a surprise to spend an early pick on a running back. But Bijan Robinson is the best offensive player available, and Arthur Smith looks to build a dominant running game. Robinson could also be a big factor as a receiver.\n\n9. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS: TYREE WILSON TEXAS TECH EDGE\n\nWe are high on Tyree Wilson as we have him as our #2 edge. The Seahawks need to build up the defensive line and get players who can affect the passer. \n\n10. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES: MYLES MURPHY CLEMSON EDGE\n\nThe Eagles can afford to go with the best player available. They have a lot of free agents coming up in 2023, especially on the defensive line. \n\n11. TENNESSEE TITANS: BRODERICK JONES GEORGIA OT\n\nTennessee has several needs to address but with Taylor Lewan not being able to stay healthy, the Titans look to build up their offensive line.\n\n12. HOUSTON TEXANS: QUENTIN JOHNSON TCU WR\n\nCooks could be departing this off-season adding Quentin Johnson along with John Metchie and Nico Collins will give Young a good receiving core to grow with. \n\n13. NEW YORK JETS: \u2013 BRIAN BRANCH ALABAMA S\n\nThe most glaring need for the Jets is the quarterback position but I expect them not to take on another project and find a veteran QB. I like the addition of adding Branch to an already top defense. \n\n14. NEW ENGLAND PATRIOTS \u2013 PARIS JOHNSON OHIO STATE OT\n\nI like the fit of the Patriots trading back and landing a receiver like Jaxon Smith-Njigba but at 14 it may be too rich. Johnson gives the Patriots a good replacement for Isaiah Wynn who I don\u2019t expect them to re-sign. \n\n15. GREEN BAY PACKERS:  LUKAS VAN NESS IOWA DL\n\nVan Ness is a more athletic version of Dean Lowry and Aaron Kampman both of which had success with the Packers.  \n\n16.  WASHINGTON REDSKINS: CAM SMITH SOUTH CAROLINA CB\n\nA quarterback has been the biggest hole for the Redskins the past few seasons. We like Sam Howell but even if they decide to go a different route, I think they will go for a veteran like Jimmy G or Derek Carr.   \n\n17. PITTSBURGH STEELERS:  PETER SKORONSKI NORTHWESTERN OT\n\nThe Steelers have holes all over the offensive line and draft a versatile one in Skoronski. \n\n18.   DETROIT LIONS: TRENTON SIMPSON CLEMSON LB \n\nThe Lions had one of the better offenses in the league this season and will look to use this draft to build up that defense.  \n\n19.  TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS: ANTHONY RICHARDSON FLORIDA QB \n\nRichardson is an exciting prospect but has not played many games and needs development. \n\n20. SEATTLE SEAHAWKS: JOEY PORTER PENN STATE CB\n\nThe Seahawks look to continue to build on a position of weakness going into the 2022 season to a position of strength heading into 2023. \n\n21. MIAMI DOLPHINS: PICK FORFEITED \n\n22.  LOS ANGELES CHARGERS:  SIAKI \u201cAPU\u201d IKA BAYLOR DT\n\nThe Chargers have been one of the worst run defenses the past two seasons. Ika can help your run defense and has some juice as a rusher. \n\n23. BALTIMORE RAVENS: JORDAN ADDISON PITTSBURGH WR\n\nThe Ravens have to get Lamar some weapons Sammy Watkins, Demarcus Robinson, and Desean Jackson are not going to cut it. They could look at offensive tackle as well where Ronnie Stanley has played in 13 games the past three seasons. \n\n24. MINNESOTA VIKINGS DEVON WEATHERSPOON ILLINOIS CB\n\nWeatherspoon was as good as any corner this past season and the Vikings were the worst pass defense in the league.\n\n25.  JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS: MICHAEL MAYER NOTRE DAME TE\n\nI would look for the Jaguars to trade up for a tackle are stay where they're at and get Trevor Lawrence a weapon that can also help as a blocker. \n\n26. NEW YORK GIANTS: JOSH DOWNS NORTH CAROLINA WR\n\nBrian Daboll could make a run for one of his former wide receivers Gabe Davis in free agency, but they need to continue to add more weapons for Daniel Jones. \n\n27. DALLAS COWBOYS: DREW SANDERS ARKANSAS LB\n\nVander Esch will be a free agent this offseason and the Cowboys have been willing to spend high draft picks on linebackers.\n\n28. CINCINATTI BENGALS: KELEE RINGO GEORGIA CB\n\nThe Bengals look to build up more depth in the secondary as Eli Apple and Tre Flowers are both free agents.  \n\n29. DENVER BRONCOS: JAELYN DUNCAN MARYLAND OT\n\nDuncan needs to be more consistent, but he has rare movement skills for a player of his size.\n\n30. BUFFALO BILLS: ANTONIO JOHNSON S TEXAS A&M\n\nPoyer is a free agent this offseason and Johnson is good value this late in the first round. \n\n31. KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: LUKE MUSGRAVE TE OREGON STATE \n\nMusgrave is one of our favorite players in this year\u2019s draft and has the athletic upside to be Kelce's eventual replacement. \n\n32. PHILADELPHIA EAGLES:  JAHMYR GIBBS ALABAMA RB\n\nBoston Scott and Miles Sanders are free agents and Gibbs brings an exciting element to the Eagles both as a runner, receiver, and returner.",

He was really solid this past season and we have Morgan Moses under contract for cheap and Patrick Mekari as our backup / swing tackle.

So if there is more talent at the receiver spot that\u2019s where the pick should be. I\u2019d also really question drafting a guy because he could replace Kelce eventually when the team needs a day 1 starter at edge and potentially day 1 starters at both tackle spots. There are too many needs to take a Kelce replacement.",
      "replies": [
        "It's a bit of a catch-22 imo. If you think a prospect is the next Travis Kelce then he should go top 25. If you think he is a developmental TE with Kelce upside then the Chiefs already have guys waiting for their shot. \n\nBased on the current roster, I'd have OL as the top need by itself.  RT is an obvious upgrade position and they potentially can save money on the left side of the line.",

        "Normally id agree with that, but especially if Rodgers is gone by April, the defense needs help at Edge without Gary and Safety without Amos. There\u2019s nobody available at 15 for offense that\u2019s worth taking. We don\u2019t need an OLineman, Johnston is gone and I don\u2019t think Addison is a good fit for the scheme and I don\u2019t like picking a tight end that high unless its Kyle Pitts. This is a defensive draft early and the Packers philosophy actually fits the available talent without reaching. They\u2019d do well to probably even trade back and pick up and extra 2nd or 2 and go heavy offense in the second round and grab a tight end and receiver there. Van Ness is a good pick and scheme fit."

Even if Jawaan Taylor walks, Walker Little has been *really* good when we've given him a chance, so I suspect he gets a shot there. We need depth at the position, sure, but a depth OT feels a bt rich to be trading away draft capital to acquire OT depth.

Now, Roseman is exceptional with the cap, and he'll restructure a few contracts and free up enough space to re-sign some players, but he's also going to have to work out a monster contract for Jalen Hurts. He's not going to be able to keep most of these players:\n\n* James Bradberry [CB] (Gone, outplayed his contract and doubtful we can afford him)\n\n* Chauncey Gardner-Johnson [S/NCB] (I'd say we try to re-sign him, but Spotrac has his market APY at 14m)\n\n* Marcus Epps [S] (Unsure, may let him go to give Blankenship a starting chance)\n\n* TJ Edwards [LB] (Had a breakout year, will be able to demand good money, but may be able to afford)\n\n* Kyzir White [LB] (Hasn't been great, probably let go to finally give Nakobe Dean a chance)\n\n* Brandon Graham [EDGE] (Unsure, aging, but just had his best year. Hopefully okay with taking a team-friendly deal, or may retire)\n\n* Fletcher Cox [IDL] (Aging, on the decline but better than he was last year. Probably gone or retiring)\n\n* Javon Hargrave [IDL] (Doubtful we could afford him)\n\n* Plus some key rotational players like Linval Joseph and Ndamukong Suh (replaceable with Jordan Davis)\n\nSo we're probably looking at voids at:\n\n* IDL (specifically 3T) and we use a ton of rotation on the DL, Howie usually gets 3 or more starting caliber players at both positions\n\n* EDGE (and we use a ton of rotation on the DL, Howie usually gets 3 or more starting caliber players at both positions). And no, Derek Barnett is not an answer there\n\n* LB (Unless we retain Edwards)\n\n* CB (the outside corners behind Bradberry are atrocious, plus we'll need to find Slay's eventual successor)\n\n* S (depending on CGJ contract)\n\nSo basically every level of defense. A couple of those holes will be filled in free agency, but even looking at potential restructures, we're not going to have much wiggle room. \n\nOn defense, this is not a team with a super great 2023 roster that can afford luxury picks. I'd go so far as to say we should use the Panthers' strategy from a few years ago and just use every pick on defense",

Some reasons why it could happen:\n\nThe Raiders have the 7th pick currently, not too far back for teams trading back but still hope to get a blue chip player.\n\nThe Raiders need a QB with Carr on the outs.\n\nSpeaking of Carr, he pretty much became the scapegoat for a disappointing season, with the QB position being publicly stated as the excuse, is there an organizational obligation to address the position aggressively?\n\nMcDaniels and Ziegler drew a lot of heat in their first season in what was a disappointing season for a team thought to be a contender.\n\nSpeaking of McDaniels, he's now backed into a corner with his reputation as an offensive guru who blamed Carr for last season, drawing the ire of raider nation. Is he feeling pressured to prove himself with a new QB?\n\nThe Raiders are also unfortunately in an under the radar win now situation with key pieces of the offense highly paid and aging. The real assets of the team are Adams and Waller, both in their 30s and on big contracts.\n\nThere's a lot of smoke concerning Brady to Las Vegas, but even the biggest Brady fans will concede he doesn't have a lot of time left. Who could possibly be a better mentor than the goat?\n\n The team has a lot of holes, but the biggest hole undoubtedly is the QB position, how will they go about righting the ship?\n\nWith all of this in mind, do you think the raiders trade up?",

  "selftext": "Right now, that might seem like a questionable choice, given the presence of Swift and Jamaal Williams, as well as the Lions\u2019 needs clearly being more centered around defense. Here\u2019s why I think it\u2019s still a possibility:\n\n-\tSwift is very injury prone. In his career going back to college he has had many nagging ankle, groin, and shoulder injuries. When playing injured he very clearly loses his decisiveness and tries to dance around contact, and it hurt his value a lot.\n-\tGoing off of that, Bijan replicates Swift\u2019s receiving ability to a nearly equal degree, while also having better running ability, especially through contact. \n-\tJamaal is an upcoming UFA. I still think the Lions will sign him, even if they target Bijan. But if they don\u2019t manage to get a deal done, the need becomes very significant.\n-\tThe Lions OL would serve Bijan very well, given his skillset. He broke over 100 tackles last year, which is nuts, and the Lions\u2019 line should be able to clear holes to get him to the second level where he can really shine.\n-\tIdeally, the Lions are a run heavy offense. Bijan is a true 3-down back who can stay on the field for as long as you need him to\n-\t18th pick is a very reasonable range for him to go, given the trends of positional value in the NFL combined with his elite talent\n-\tJared Goff thrives with talent surrounding him. This year he was more run game-proof, but still, I\u2019d feel better about him as a long term option if the Lions had a lockdown, stud RB.\n-\tBrad Holmes has only drafted consensus blue-chip talent in the first round (albeit with mostly very high picks). If he doesn\u2019t feel there are any elite defensive contributors left at 18, it seems very possible he could go there.\n-\tAlso, when Holmes was with the Rams, they drafted multiple runningbacks in the top 2 rounds. \n\nWhat do you all think? I know the Lions fanbase might not love this, but I think Bijan would put that offense on another level.",

      "body": "I think there\u2019s a possibility it happens if like you said, no one jumps out at 18. This defense is very very young with lots of rookies/sophomores playing significant minutes. I could see them wanting to see what they have with those picks without trying to replace them with a new shiny thing. \n\nBetween Walker and Kerby, we have a well established starting safety and an a young budding team star in Kerby Joseph. The cornerback room could really use some help, but that might be addressed with their first pick. The d-line has a ton of youth. We had 5 guys under 25 playing significant minutes this season. If Levi Onwuzurike ever gets healthy (it\u2019s a big if though), you\u2019d be adding another young player to that d-line. Finally, I don\u2019t think this FO values linebackers very highly in the draft but we also have some youth there. Derrick Barnes (4th round sophomore) and Malcolm Rodriguez (6th round rookie) are both 23 and have played considerable minutes. While Brad Holmes was in LA, they never focused on drafting LBs early and he hasn\u2019t here in Detroit. \n\nWith all of that being put together, I think an argument could be made for Bijan to Detroit if he\u2019s there. He\u2019s not my first choice at pick 18, but if Holmes and Co don\u2019t think any defender is worth 18, I wouldn\u2019t be upset with Bijan. We still have 2 second round picks where there will be a ton of defensive lineman available.",

        "this is hilarious. it's true for most non-premium positions as well. RB is definitely the worst of the group, but try giving a team a guard, or an off ball linebacker in the first round and they'll descend upon you like a flock of birds to peck your eyes out for your horrible take. \n\nthe best are the \"my team has NEVER taken X position in the first round, you are so stupid!\" the one i remember the most was the Chiefs the year they took CEH. Dare to mock a RB to the Chiefs and you would get a copied and pasted speech about how Andy Reid has never valued the position. It probably would have been a good move for the Chiefs too if they picked Taylor or Swift instead of CEH.\n\nOne of the best parts of how teams make these claims is that most teams dont have GMs that have been around for a decade. Most have a handful of drafts under their belt and they'll draw these conclusions anyway. Even for a team like my Patriots where BB has been around for multiple decades, there are still shocks in how positions are valued. The Patriots never valued the RB. Then they took Lawrence Maroney in the first round. And clearly they learned their lesson from that right? Over a decade went by without a first round pick at RB. Then they take Sony Michel. And yet, fan bases will still tell you that a mock pick you made is.... impossible",

But good teams all want good RBs and Bijan Robinson should absolutely go in the first round",
        ">They could target a CB early and then circle back around to fortify a strength on an offense that doesn't have any real holes.\n\nI'm all for Gonzalez or Witherspoon at 6 and then BPA (even if it's Bijan) at 18. The only real weakness on offense is RG imo (although another WR if Chark leaves in FA could be a need as well). Evan Brown is a good backup center and can play guard but is the weak spot on the OL. Having said that, I would be a little nervous about going OL too early. The Lions already have three first rounders on the line, have signed Decker and Ragnow to big extensions, and I would imagine both Jackson and obviously Sewell get extensions as well. The cost is gonna add up.",

The only need I really view as dire is CB, and tbh I\u2019d be shocked if they don\u2019t pick one with their top pick (unless Carter or Anderson somehow fall). Don\u2019t forget they also have FA to address these needs.\n\nAlso, they ended the year 8-2 and ranked like top 3 in DVOA over that span.

Here\u2019s the tally\u2026\n\nRB\u2019s drafted by round: \n\nRound 1: 7 or 6 depending on how you view CEH.\n\nRound 2: 14.\n\nRound 3: 6. (Though these seem to be committees.)\n\nRound 4: 3. (4 if including Hubbard.)\n\nRound 5: 2. \n\nRound 6: 1\u2026ish. \n\nRound 7: 0 or 1 depending on how you view Pacheco. \n\nUDFA: 1. \n\nRB\u2019s acquired thru FA or trade: 3. (4 if you count Jamaal Williams.) Of those players, half were Top 100 picks, one was Round 1. \n\nIt\u2019s clear that Round 2 is the money spot for RB\u2019s, followed by Round 1 (or a tie with Round 3 with how you view the CEH/Pacheco situation) and Round 2 alone has more RB\u2019s drafted than all of Rounds 3-7 combined. (Ties with rounds 3-7 cause Chiefs.) With more than half the NFL choosing to address their RB situation within the first two rounds I would say it\u2019s time to put to death of the \u201clet\u2019s wait until later to draft a RB!\u201d chat when that simply isn\u2019t the case.",
        "The first round pick RB for the Chiefs has been on IR for two months, only saw double digit carries in one game, and even when he was healthy this year he was outplayed by a 7th round rookie and a vet min FA, so I'm not sure including him is the best example.",
        "Bijan will go in the first round and high. But your point is not very good lol. The Chiefs first round RB has been outperformed and not healthy. Same with the Cowboys running back. Running back has been far from the reason for success for the Bills and Bengals too. \n\nI\u2019d argue the only teams that can really attribute much of their success to their RB play is the 49ers and Giants. Etienne has been solid, but he\u2019s not what lead them on a massive comeback. \n\nGood teams largely have great passing attacks regardless of who is playing RB."

The only real weakness on offense is RG imo (although another WR if Chark leaves in FA could be a need as well). Evan Brown is a good backup center and can play guard but is the weak spot on the OL. Having said that, I would be a little nervous about going OL too early. The Lions already have three first rounders on the line, have signed Decker and Ragnow to big extensions, and I would imagine both Jackson and obviously Sewell get extensions as well.

That just means teams are going to view him closer to a Josh Jacobs type prospect rather than a Gurley type. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s Saquon but he is an elite RB prospect for sure. I think on the Lions sub someone was like \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind drafting him if he fell to our 48th pick in the 2nd but not with either of our 1sts.\u201d So it\u2019s like\u2026 then you *do* mind drafting him lol. The chances of him going at 48\u2026 some serious shit has had to happen. \n\n\nOn another note\u2026 didn\u2019t we do a mock a few years back where you drafted Justin Jefferson to the Vikings and your entire sub flipped out and said that would never happen? LOL that was awesome when it happened"

He has the 3rd most receptions, 8th most receiving yards, and 2nd most receiving TDs in the league. No one says the Bills lack a WR1 but Kelce has more catches and TDs with slightly less efficiency than Diggs. \n\nI also disagree that the lack of a WR1 was felt. Patrick Mahomes is going to be MVP and ended the regular season 1st in yards, TDs, and TD rate. His INT rate was better than Burrow and top half of the league. The Chiefs had the most efficient offense in the league at 6.4 yards per play with 46 percent of drives ending in an offensive score. None of that screams the Chiefs need better playmakers.",

There\u2019s always variation but generally you know where most players will fall, especially the beginning of the first round.

And to be clear the issue isn\u2019t \u201chot takes\u201d, the issue is player research hasn\u2019t been done prior to your mock. Skoronski is a major reach. He\u2019s talented but his measurables will at the very least keep him out of top 4 contention. If the bears don\u2019t like will Anderson and are targeting a tackle, they would certainly trade down much farther for a bigger haul. Secondly, the boutte pick is a massive risk that the GM has already shown he won\u2019t take especially with guys like downs and flowers on the board and we\u2019re mostly looking for a slot guy if we\u2019re going to see what claypool can do on the outside.",

Stingley was a guy who fell down boards all the way up to the draft for this or that, he went 3. That was just last year. There\u2019s almost always a demand for the top OT in every year and Skoronski, aside from the reach, matches up favorably against imo. It\u2019s not a hot take, I genuinely believe he could be the Bears\u2019 LT for a decade or longer and be very productive there that\u2019s just my evaluation of the player."

Levis isn\u2019t a sure fire Day One starter, but I think he\u2019d be ready to go faster than the Lions\u2019 roster would allow.\n\nOtherwise, solid picks. I love Branch, I\u2019m not sure if Mazi Smith is a Round 2 guy but it\u2019s not unreasonable and fills a need. \n\nThe only comment I have for other teams is I can\u2019t imagine Chicago and Arizona both passing on Will Anderson. He\u2019s the best player in this class, at a premium position *and* a position of need for both teams. You even say the Cardinals will miss JJ Watt and yet have them pass on him.

I also think he a little light, listed at 245 on some sites. That\u2019s not a trait that most top 5 EDGE players share, Myles Garrett was around 260, both Bosas were in that range iirc, Clowney was huge; Von Miller may have been the last lighter EDGE rusher I vividly remember going so early. He could definitely put the weight on but how will that impact his explosiveness? Those are all questions I have even though I think at worst he\u2019s a quality starter for a decade. \n\nOther guys I\u2019d put up there with him from a pure talent perspective (not considering position value) include: Johnston, Carter, Robinson, Stroud, Tyree Wilson, Joey Porter Jr. and Peter Skoronski are all at least as talented as Anderson imo."

I chose Gerard because it made more since for what type of player I expect Richardson to be, never really a top 12 QB but a guy a team can and probably will start and try to build around. He\u2019ll be a top 15-20 QB and with the right pieces can put to together exciting games and moments but never really win anything substantial. \n\nThat\u2019s just too much to type for a player comp."

        "There is no way I would take Skoronski with Will Anderson on the board. I do not want to use a high draft pick on a tackle in a pretty weak tackle class. I'm not using the #4 overall pick on an OL that may have to play guard in the NFL. The Bears are not in the market for a LT this offseason, so there is no way I would use #4 overall on a player to play right tackle or guard. Braxton Jones was one of the best rookie OLs in the game this year. Sure, he has things to improve on, but what rookie doesn't. Also, the FO talks glowingly about Jones, so there's no chance they're going to mess with his development. If we're going to stay in the top 4, we need to walk away with Carter or Anderson. I prefer Carter, but I'm okay with Anderson. Carter is just more of unique prospect than Anderson. There have been numerous prospects at edge that are on the same level as Anderson over the last 10 years. I would say Quinnen Williams is the only DT prospect in the last 10 years that matches Carter as a prospect.\n\nThen, you have us taking Boutte in the 2nd round. Jalin Hyatt, Zay Flowers, and Josh Downs are still on the board and I'd rather have any of the three. I personally love Zay Flowers. Flowers is just so twitchy and he plays bigger than he is at the catch point. Hyatt would be a great fit with Fields. Fields is a big game hunter by nature, so Hyatt would be a good compliment. Downs is just an excellent separator. I like Boutte, but he brings a lot of drama and not much production from his final season. I do think Boutte could be as good or better than these three, but he's going to have to learn how to be a professional, and I just don't want to take that risk with a rebuilding team.\n\nI'm fine with the Wypler pick. The Skoronski pick would be a disaster in my opinion. I prefer Paris Johnson as a prospect, but I don't want him either. The first pick needs to be defense unless we trade down further than 4. The Boutte pick is boom or bust for me, and I just don't want to take that risk with a rebuilding team."

There\u2019s almost always a demand for the top OT in every year and Skoronski, aside from the reach, matches up favorably against imo. It\u2019s not a hot take, I genuinely believe he could be the Bears\u2019 LT for a decade or longer and be very productive there that\u2019s just my evaluation of the player.",

That\u2019s not a trait that most top 5 EDGE players share, Myles Garrett was around 260, both Bosas were in that range iirc, Clowney was huge; Von Miller may have been the last lighter EDGE rusher I vividly remember going so early. He could definitely put the weight on but how will that impact his explosiveness? Those are all questions I have even though I think at worst he\u2019s a quality starter for a decade. \n\nOther guys I\u2019d put up there with him from a pure talent perspective (not considering position value) include: Johnston, Carter, Robinson, Stroud, Tyree Wilson, Joey Porter Jr. and Peter Skoronski are all at least as talented as Anderson imo.",

I chose Gerard because it made more since for what type of player I expect Richardson to be, never really a top 12 QB but a guy a team can and probably will start and try to build around.

  "selftext": "With the Senior Bowl less than two weeks away, I thought I'd start looking at the position groups and list who I'm most excited to see. Today, we look at the wide receivers. I stuck to just 10 I'll be looking forward to seeing\n\n1. Rashee Rice, SMU\nI've seen a mixed bag on Rice, you either love him or hate him, no inbetween. I love him personally. Prototypical size and looks to be a hell of an athlete. A good week in Mobile could solidify him as a first round WR.\n\n2. Nathaniel \"Tank\" Dell, Houston\nIf Tank was 6'0\" 195 there would be no debate on who the best WR in this class is. I think his size limits him to like Calvin Austin range, but I think he dominates the 1 on 1's. Putting him in early day 2 discussion.\n\n3. Charlie Jones, Purdue \nCharlie Jones is just one hell of a football player man. He maybe doesn't possess the elite traits you look for, but I think he can be a productive slot WR at the next level. A good week in Mobile would really help his stock.\n\n4. Andrei Iosivas, Princeton\nProbably the guy I'm most eager to see out of all these guys. He's got prototypical X receiver size with great athletic ability. Just want to see how he does against the best\n\n5. Dontayvion Wicks, Virginia \nEarly gut feeling tells me Wicks comes away as the biggest winner of the week, and I should have him higher. Bigger body WR with great fluidity and movement skills\n\n6. Xavier Hutchinson, Iowa State \nIt seems like Hutchinson was putting up 100 yards every time he touched the field this years. That's impressive considering the state of Iowa State's offense. He plays wide open every play, coaches will take notice of that\n\n7. Jonathan Mingo, Ole Miss\nMingo wasn't even really on my radar until he busted out for 9/247/3 against Vandy. He has a lot of traits I like, good blend of size and athleticism. Will be interested to see how he does throughout the week.\n\n8. Ronnie Bell, Michigan \nBell wasn't fully \"let loose\" in Michigan's offense since they were a ground and pound football team. He has great speed and YAC ability, just needs to put it on display. He'll have a great opportunity on Mobile.\n\n9. Jayden Reed, Michigan State\nReed maybe doesn't possess the elite athletic traits you look for, but he's a smart football player who can line up anywhere. Showing off his versatility will be huge for him.\n\n10. Trey Palmer, Nebraska \nPalmer could easily end up running the fastest 40 time at the Combine come March. If he can can have a big week in Mobile, showing that his speed translates onto the field, he could fly up boards",

He tracks the ball well with his eyes and can contort his body to make catches, but he struggles with drops and body catches. He ran a ton of screens and curls, but he did show competency when asked to run other routes. Rice struggles to sell double moves and lacks fluidity. He's a tough runner with the ball in his hands, able to drag defenders with him. He shows a good motor and is a solid blocker.\n\nI'll probably go back and watch more tape given how high everyone else seems to be on him. I think strong testing will also boost my grade on him.

He's also had 5 punt return touchdowns throughout his college career but had 2 of them called back.\n\nMight be lacking in height a bit but he makes up for it with how physical he is at the catch point and his ball tracking ability.\n\nHere's an example vs Ohio State: [https://www.youtube.com/shorts/juTJVexkLDw](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/juTJVexkLDw)\n\nEdit: The obvious comparison for Reed is Reagor, and when u look at their college stats they are near identical.

Now that will obviously change as we get closer to the draft and we will get a clearer view on who teams have near the top of their boards. The way it seems now is that Young has the best IQ and high throwing skills but lacks the size for the NFL and even though some smaller QBs have succeeded at the next level, it\u2019s still not ideal. Stroud is the most accurate and has good size, but there are questions about his athleticism and decision making at the next level. Levis obviously has all the physical gifts people are looking for at the next level, but seems to lack accuracy, IQ (just not the same level as the other 2), and he\u2019s the oldest of the 3 which is a negative.

        "I explained this in my post. Did you read it before you downvoted?\n\n1. It's a bad WR draft. Jeremiah only has two WRs in the first round in this mock and they're at picks #25 and #31. One of them (JSN) is presumably slot-only. I don't think overpaying for a WR because it's a position of need is smart drafting, particularly when speedier guys like Flowers, Hyatt, Downs, etc. would presumably be available later in the draft.\n\n2. I think the most pressing need for the Chargers is explosiveness on offense. Bijan Robinson meets that need -- period.\n\n3. I think he and Ekeler are both three-down backs (due to their receiving ability) so I think they pair well together. Ekeler himself has repeatedly asked the Chargers to bring in another strong RB. Plus, he's older and going to be a 29 year-old free agent after the 2023 season. You need to either draft or sign someone good within the next year, anyways.\n\n4. Ekeler is not a \"top of the league RB,\" man. He's a good and useful player but he's not some dominant rusher. Hell, he's the third-best RB in his own division behind Jacobs and J Williams (assuming health). Stop using fantasy football to evaluate actual football. The Chargers would still be in the playoffs if they had a better running attack and part of that issue falls on Ekeler (and the other really ineffective RBs the Chargers have added in later rounds in recent drafts).\n\n5. Most of the best RBs in the league have been drafted early, like in the 1st/2nd round. I completely disagree with the idea that you can't pay (with draft capital) for a great RB and that RBs \"don't matter\". Good RBs are important! It's the second contract component that catches you but drafting an elite playmaker for Herbert's age 25-30 years seems not just \"okay\" but downright smart."

Now that will obviously change as we get closer to the draft and we will get a clearer view on who teams have near the top of their boards. The way it seems now is that Young has the best IQ and high throwing skills but lacks the size for the NFL and even though some smaller QBs have succeeded at the next level, it\u2019s still not ideal. Stroud is the most accurate and has good size, but there are questions about his athleticism and decision making at the next level. Levis obviously has all the physical gifts people are looking for at the next level, but seems to lack accuracy, IQ (just not the same level as the other 2), and he\u2019s the oldest of the 3 which is a negative. Honestly I\u2019m a Colts fan who trusts Ballard in the draft, so whatever he decides, I\u2019ll eventually get on board.

Jeremiah only has two WRs in the first round in this mock and they're at picks #25 and #31. One of them (JSN) is presumably slot-only. I don't think overpaying for a WR because it's a position of need is smart drafting, particularly when speedier guys like Flowers, Hyatt, Downs, etc. would presumably be available later in the draft.\n\n2. I think the most pressing need for the Chargers is explosiveness on offense. Bijan Robinson meets that need -- period.\n\n3. I think he and Ekeler are both three-down backs (due to their receiving ability) so I think they pair well together. Ekeler himself has repeatedly asked the Chargers to bring in another strong RB. Plus, he's older and going to be a 29 year-old free agent after the 2023 season. You need to either draft or sign someone good within the next year, anyways.\n\n4. Ekeler is not a \"top of the league RB,\" man. He's a good and useful player but he's not some dominant rusher. Hell, he's the third-best RB in his own division behind Jacobs and J Williams (assuming health). Stop using fantasy football to evaluate actual football. The Chargers would still be in the playoffs if they had a better running attack and part of that issue falls on Ekeler (and the other really ineffective RBs the Chargers have added in later rounds in recent drafts).\n\n5. Most of the best RBs in the league have been drafted early, like in the 1st/2nd round. I completely disagree with the idea that you can't pay (with draft capital) for a great RB and that RBs \"don't matter\". Good RBs are important! It's the second contract component that catches you but drafting an elite playmaker for Herbert's age 25-30 years seems not just \"okay\" but downright smart."

I think the Ravens and a lot of other teams would never value an RB at more than $8-10m on the open market anyway.\n\nTo me it makes more sense to get a player that's 75% of Bijan in round 3.

  "selftext": "Hey everyone,\n\nBelow are my pre-combine/senior bowl edge rankings. These are all rather in-depth scouting reports of each player, so feel free to click each link for strengths, weaknesses, attributes, pro comparisons, etc. Also, there is a link at the top of each for a more navigable format, especially if you are on mobile.\nProspects with First Round Grades:\n\n1. [Will Anderson]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ztKJIPmOlnOvWJr9dL5TTeFNt5WYC9-WRFfK-fJkFI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n2. [Tyree Wilson]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vOtgWVypYO7Z_I1QJWTCJCvcHvBjpwtbo1Q64C5ZLMI/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n3. [Felix Anudike-Uzomah]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B-AUVQbJwc949-1NjUBwCWECCzWES9kXO5VSrqc_iB8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n4. [Myles Murphy]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ReUyqKdHtHNLyEiTrSOMzAqjM6Mj4tKjrHZdyDn3tXg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n5. [Nolan Smith]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lxN5lVA7K9aXVeG6hXhweg3QaopuI9NQuxte_C-zXtM/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n6. [B.J. Ojulari]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L5dk6gPNk2utZIfrVxR-fK__p7Vp9sIu05I0Rzyafa8/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nI will address the two prospects that deviate the most from consensus. First, Myles Murphy getting a grade of a mid-late first. I get that this is wild, but saying his tape is unpolished would be a compliment. He really has absolutely no pass rush moves whatsoever. I am unsure what they are teaching over at Clemson because Bryan Bresee has a similar issue.\n\nMurphy is an incredibly rare specimen with unbelievable movement skills at over 275lbs who can play across multiple defensive fronts. His pro comparison is former first overall pick Travon Walker because he really is that freaky of an athlete. Just understand that any team drafting him will not get a pro-ready edge prospect. He may take some time to develop, and there is obviously no guarantee that he ever lives up to his potential. Murphy could easily end up as the number one player in this entire draft class by the time it is all said and done, so I have no issue with him going top 10. I personally just value pro readiness more than most, and Murphy is far from it.\n\nSecond, Felix Anudike-Uzomah is my dude. He does not have the burst or athleticism coveted by NFL teams, but seemingly wins more one-on-one matchups than anyone else in class. He is constantly doubled due to the Kansas State 3-3-5, and admittedly does not gain pressure when doubled as often as someone like Tyree Wilson. After watching the first couple of games, all I wanted was to see was him lined up as a 4-3 defensive end. He is excellent with his hands, drive, and collapsing the pocket, as well as strong run defender. If he can gain 10-15lbs or so, which I believe is possible with his frame, I genuinely think that he could be one of the best 4-3 defensive ends in the league despite his lack of twitch. I think he is at worst a pro ready end who will be adequate on all three downs right off the bat, so I would feel comfortable taking him in the first if I ran a 4-3 defense.\n\nFinally, I have one notable exclusion who is a borderline first rounder and may easily end up in the top 32 on my final draft board:\n\n7. [Lukas Van Ness]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-1ap1sX0tMkygzXcV8IYTeRxuPHMfXlfEaXVeWWbXY/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nVan Ness is the most ferocious bull rusher in this class. As only a sophomore, his size and playstyle will surely be appealing to the NFL. He may be worthy of a first round pick as it is with his position and current skill level. As a power rusher only who is weaker in the run game, there are just other guys who I believe should go before him. He will likely improve and has high potential, but he did not win often enough, even on his more technical reps, while playing limited snaps to elicit a first round grade.\n\nThose are my top prospects to this point, but there are three other prospects getting some first round hype that I do not think will return value before the third round or so. This may be harsh, but then again, I personally value the current ability to win one-on-one against a tackle more strongly than raw athleticism in the first couple of rounds. Here are the three I do not believe live up to the hype:\n\n8. [Andre Carter II]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14_BJmjYeMMGm_huUi_Pdwzc7oKDTsv_xYuJLoneEdz0/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n9. [Zach Harrison]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TFnXWuEI_8MhPIxFuAHiYK3K9I8Uv8KrwMuDVyVW-Xg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n10. [Isaiah Foskey]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sEoJWND47quAZXl-4iEaWWOVhiKGgO3sO-bQlvpJbA4/edit?usp=sharing)\n\nThere are a couple of prospects I have not gotten to yet who may surpass these guys, and I have [Derick Hall]( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A_MNqKtG6Kz7juMLLHGk43Nt27LGL95Wd7SZtzlbPyc/edit?usp=sharing) in the mix as well, but these three are the ones who have gotten some first round buzz in my circles over the last couple of months. Andre Carter is one heck of an athlete, but has absolutely zero play strength. He tries to finesse his way around running backs at times instead of going through them, and can get locked up by tight ends. His movement skills are incredible for his size, but clearly has received poor coaching and had very questionable usage at Army. I would rather have him than the other two on this list because of his raw athleticism and apparent ability to be coached and molded nearly from scratch, but he may not be able to earn much playing time for a couple of years.\n\nZach Harrison is a beast, but has not displayed such on the field. I have checked these stats often because I simply cannot fathom that this is true, but apparently the 6\u20196\u201d 271 behemoth has 35.5\u201d arms and runs a 4.41 40-yard-dash. The former 5 star recruit had rankings on 247 Sports coming out with a 10/10 in Pursuit, Closing Speed, Athleticism, and Frame. His report includes \u201cGenerational testing numbers at his size,\u201d and reads unlike any other high school report I have seen.\n\nUnfortunately, he seems to have never been able to translate that to the field. Harrison has lower production numbers all around, and really looks awkward out there at times. I even gave him a lower athleticism grade because he does not have the fluidity or agility to compensate for his lack of play strength. There are reps where it starts coming together and he bull rushes offensive tackles into the quarterback. He even has success at times with poor technique due to his unique build. If he has ample coaching, then his traits may help him become one of the better power edge rushers in the game. He has early buzz because of his insane measurables, but will likely not earn playing time off the bat.\n\nFoskey is the most confusing member of this tier to me. He has strong reps sprinkled throughout his tape, but is still unpolished. He is not the athlete of the other mid day two prospects, and has many of the same issues. He has decent production, but he also seemed to go against dreadful competition in a couple of his games. With his issues regarding pad level, release, and overall athleticism, the first round buzz is odd. I have him firmly as a third round pick who has room to improve, and could be a solid rotational pass rusher from the edge. He just is not the kind of player I would seek in the first couple of rounds.\n\nAt this point, some of my rankings differ from consensus. I do believe Myles Murphy will go inside the top 10-15 because of his athleticism, and I do think Felix Anudike-Uzomah falls to round two for the same reason. I also am still trying to reconcile grades of immediate impact verses project players. I think some teams should take a swing at Murphy in the early first or Andre Carter a round ahead of where I have him graded if they have the luxury of not thrusting them into a starting role. I would take Ojulari over Anudike-Uzomah if I ran primarily a 3-4, and Van Ness over Ojulari if I ran a 4-3. Rankings are not stagnant across every team, and my grades will probably fluctuate over the course of the off-season.\n\nAlso, below is a link to a similar post from a couple weeks ago regarding wide receivers:\n\n[2023 Wide Receiver Scouting Reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/NFL_Draft/comments/103fkuj/2023_wide_receiver_scouting_reports_rankings/?ref=share&ref_source=link)",

I will say that his release from the line is very efficient from the reps I\u2019ve seen, amplifying his burst. I\u2019ll get to him soon.

He is big and strong than that enables him to do really well against the run.  He holds his point and was disciplined with his gaps.  Recall PFF being pretty high on his performances despite the lack of sacks.\n\nI think his future is as a 5T and not as an edge. I think that is where his ceiling is the highest.  He played some DT at OSU as well, though more on passing downs."

I labeled him as the most well-rounded edge prospect in class. One of my favorite prospects to watch, who hopefully can jump into the top 5 with a full healthy season under his belt. Remember he played through injury the entire rest of the season after I believe week 4-ish. Absolute stud made of pure muscle who can win with both speed and power\n\nEdit: So I guess a lot of what I had was based on projection from his high-end reps. He certainly put up tape that showed that he was worthy of a top 10 pick, but other tape that was not quite as strong. I put more emphasis on what I saw from his high end reps since he proved what kind of player he could be at the next level, but him going back to school makes me believe that teams did not all see it that way."

This year, I\u2019ll need to spend more time on these 2023 guys, although currently my tentative rankings really don\u2019t differ much from consensus.

Murphy has great speed/explosiveness at 6\u20195 275, has more bend to him, and has good length and power to him as well. Not to mention, he\u2019s nearly 2 years younger.

Here\u2019s an excerpt:\n\n\u201cMorris has enticing size and movement skills at 291lbs, but is far from being a polish prospect. He has some good strength and hands on the initial contact, but no refined go-to pass rush moves. He gets redirected off the ball too easily in the run game, where there also appear to be some effort concerns. His release is often late, and he plays to upright at times, mitigating much of his initial power. Taking a shot on him early day three could yield a positive return if a coach can develop his raw talent, but he is likely going to be no more than a back up with some pass rush upside as it currently stands.\u201d\n\nI have not looked into the other two just yet."

He\u2019s not as quick as a 235 pounder should be, and while he\u2019s good for his size at defending the run, he\u2019s about 20 pounds undersized for the position in the NFL. His pass rush just plain doesn\u2019t get home. He flat out doesn\u2019t have the mass or the strength to beat OTs.

He certainly put up tape that showed that he was worthy of a top 10 pick, but other tape that was not quite as strong. I put more emphasis on what I saw from his high end reps since he proved what kind of player he could be at the next level, but him going back to school makes me believe that teams did not all see it that way."

All I\u2019ll say now is Caleb Williams is absolutely legit from the  few games I saw. This year, I\u2019ll need to spend more time on these 2023 guys, although currently my tentative rankings really don\u2019t differ much from consensus.

He has some good strength and hands on the initial contact, but no refined go-to pass rush moves. He gets redirected off the ball too easily in the run game, where there also appear to be some effort concerns. His release is often late, and he plays to upright at times, mitigating much of his initial power. Taking a shot on him early day three could yield a positive return if a coach can develop his raw talent, but he is likely going to be no more than a back up with some pass rush upside as it currently stands.\u201d\n\nI have not looked into the other two just yet."

  "selftext": "**Tier 1: Studs at the top and depth**\n\n1. Running Back) A\n\nthis RB class is absurd. It's rare that there are this many prospects I thought could be high end NFL running backs while still having bona fide studs in Bijan and Gibbs. Bijan especially is in the top 3-5 RB prospects in the past decade in my opinion. That high end talent + depth makes this the best RB class since at least 2017, with the potential to outperform even that.\n\n2. Cornerback) A-\n\nNot quite of the level of RB because it is difficult to identify any true outliers in this class, but I\u2019m almost certain a few of Gonzalez, Witherspoon, Smith, Porter Jr., Forbes, and even Ringo will be in the pro bowl conversation in a couple years. This class is also stacked with talent in the second to fourth rounds which mean teams can get a premium corner without a expensive pick. \n\n3. Center) A-\n\nCenter isn\u2019t exactly a premium position so I can\u2019t put it above RB or CB (although neither of those are the most premium either). But, if your team needs a center upgrade, this is the year to get someone on day two who could be at the top of their position. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tier 2: Deep but not many elite prospects**\n\n4. EDGE) B+\n\n Will Anderson is a monster and the kind of edge prospect we see once ever two or three years. However, I don\u2019t think there are enough clear cut elite edges in this class to put it in tier 1. Tyree Wilson and Myles Murphy are good prospect but not stars leaving Anderson as the only obvious top 10 pick of the bunch. However, the late first and onwards is stacked with prospect like Ojulari, Anudike-Uzomah, Carter II, Nolan Smith, Van Ness, etc. that should make this a great class for grabbing a mid round edge player.\n\n5. Tight End) B-\n\nThere are some people who absolutely love this tight end class, but I just think its pretty good. There is no blue chip tight end like Vernon Davis, Pitts, or Bowers which keeps this from being a top tier tight end class. And, while Myers is a solid prospect, there\u2019s usually some tight end like him. Darnell Washington is a special blocker, but blocking tight ends are dime a dozen. Although I think this class gets stronger past the first round with Washington(maybe first rounder), Musgrave, Kincaid, Latu, etc. in the 2-3rd range.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tier 3: Some high end prospects, but not an all around incredible class**\n\n6. Defensive Tackle) C+\n\nJalen Carter is up there with Bijan and Anderson for the most individually skilled player in this draft, and I really like some of the raw prospects like Mazi Smith and Calijah Kancey. But too many of the DTs in this class are half-baked prospects who could be great but could also flop. I also don\u2019t love the DTs available after day 2.\n\n7. Quarterback) C+\n\nThis is a pretty average QB class. A good variety of high end talent with Bryce Young, Stroud, Levis, and Richardson but no one who jumps off the page as generational. And in the mid rounds, Hooker, Nixon, Haener, Hall, and McKee are all fine prospects but, again, no one stands out as exceptional depth choices compared to past QB years.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tier 4: Worse than previous years, but still serviceable if you need someone**\n\n8. Safety) C \n\nThis is a fine safety class. I like Branch and Antonio Johnson and some day 2 guys like Skinner and Battle, but it isn\u2019t anything special compared to past years. Not really much to say other the \u201cmeh.\u201d\n\n9. Wide Receiver) C\n\nThis is a great year if you need a slot player, between JSN, Addison, Mims, Downs, and Flowers who all profile as slot player due to their college play or build. But otherwise that, this WR class isn\u2019t it. Quentin Johnson is a good receiver, but hes probably the least exciting first receiver off the board in a few years, I also like Rashee Rice for his YAC potential and height. But beyond that, you\u2019re waiting until the 3rd or 4th round for a prospect like Tillman, Perry, or Hutchinson if you need an X.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tier 5: Weak depth, with a couple decent prospects**\n\n10. Linebacker) C- \n\nI know some people will say this is too harsh. But I don\u2019t like Sanders or Simpson as much as most and there isn\u2019t any great depth targets in this LB class (sadly for my Commanders). So this is an underwhelming class, although I guess you can grab someone on day 3 and hope since late LBs sometimes hit. \n\n11. Offensive Guard) D+\n\nI really like O\u2019Cyrus Torrence, but I think there are almost no other prospects past that. Skoronski can be an elite guard but he\u2019s being drafted as a tackle. And, given how many teams need OL help, this years draft could have a lot of reaches for mediocre players.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Tier 6: Bad, bad, bad, just no, don\u2019t draft**\n\n12. Offensive Tackle) F\n\nThis just isn\u2019t a good OT class. Skoronski and Paris Johnson have potential but after that it\u2019s gonna be just reaches for desperate teams with bad O lines. Broderick Jones is fine but he\u2019s absolutely not a first rounder any other year and all of the depth in this class is just depressing. Even with the few bright spots, it's been a while since we had an OT class this dry. Pray your QB survives next season and draft a tackle in 2024.",

      "body": "I\u2019m bullish on him, mainly because I love his pocket presence for someone this athletic.  Usually you have your east/west scrambler who will abandon the pocket to get away from the rush, and in college run away from the defender.  Those same guys take big sacks in the NFL because defenders are just faster.  They are also easier to scheme against because defenses can predict their escape plans on a stunt or overload blitz.  \n\nRichardson does a very good job stepping up in the pocket, but also rushing through the middle of the space is open.  \n\nI don\u2019t have the All-22 yet, but I don\u2019t mind some of the misses because they felt like anticipation misses where the WR wasn\u2019t where he thought he would be at (we can debate the blame for this both ways).  He does have accuracy issues but sitting for at least half a year, you can fix them.  \n\n\nIn terms of the comparison to Zach Wilson, I like Richardson better.  A big issue with Wilson was that his team was just too good for the competition his final year at BYU.  He would routinely pass up on easy short to intermediate passes for deep ones because people couldn\u2019t defend them.  He also had one of the best hip torque generation I\u2019ve ever seen.  Most guys need to plant their lead foot firmly to generate that kind of torque but he could do it off balanced.  Unfortunately, these two bad habits followed through to the NFL.  He takes long reads because he\u2019s still looking for the big play, which throws off his timing for intermediate and short throws.  If you look at his accurate passes, a lot of them are on first reads.  He doesn\u2019t adjust his feet properly to the second read progression, relies on his arm and hip torque to make the pass.  However, that throws off his accuracy and the ball floats.  There\u2019s an interception against the Patriots that highlight this aspect.  He\u2019s rolling to his right, gets pressure and throws it away.  However instead of planting his foot to throw, he casually tosses it off his back foot, ball floats, gets picked.  \n\nI think Richardson doesn\u2019t have that issue, it\u2019s mostly correcting minor tweaks on reads where he needs to put more anticipation and touch.  But his athleticism buys him time to develop, because teams have to respect his running ability.",
