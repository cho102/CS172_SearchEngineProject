His career, brief it was, had applied the lessons learned in Tokyo with the national team program, and with many of the best pitchers and position players at his side, he did not forget even some of the best skippers who honed him to be best on the mound no matter where he pitched.\n\nAlan will forever be one of many who helped the USA be ready for the formal start of baseball's Olympic story.\n\nFor Glory\n\nJohn"}, {"body": "I wonder if the property the A's ownership purchased in Las Vegas is in the Windsor Park area.....from what I've heard, it's sinking.", "replies": ["It\u2019s right across the 15 from TMobile arena, so no"]}, {"body": "Thank you for sharing! this is really inspiring stuff"}, {"body": "Bart!"}, {"body": "Padres"}, {"body": "Cubs fan here.

To me, this seems like a more accurate figure to use and it always baffled me that in a sport that absolutely *loves* its niche statistics we always just see raw attendance numbers. Stadium capacity varies quite a bit and saying, say, that the Dodgers have a 2023 Avg Attendance of 49,418 seems a bit nebulous without noting that they have the second larges ballpark in the MLB. \n\nSo, I went ahead and pulled all the current average attendance, per ESPN this morning. Along with listed stadium capacity for available tickets. This seemed like the most honest number to use since, like The Trop, not every seat is for sale and so even in the case of a sellout it would not be able to reach its \"total capacity\".\n\nWhile the top dogs are pretty much who you would assume, the middle of rankings shake up is interesting to see. \n\n\n\n\nTeam | Avg.

And then played out most of his career not even being a shortstop, and also with [the fucking Yankees](https://imgflip.com/i/7jsrfl).\n\n[Rick Rizzs' call of Luis Sojo clearing the bases in game 163](https://youtu.be/qMzJsmTkkB4?t=2483).\n\nRick himself, Dave's partner from 1983 until Dave's death (except for a few years in the early 90's), the current voice of the Mariners, and an all-time great in his own right.\n\nRandy Johnson going the distance and striking out Tim Salmon to finish game 163, and Dave's call (just keep on watching the video I linked for the Sojo hit until the 43 minute mark for it).\n\nAnd, because I distinctly remember watching this game on summer break between 3rd and 4th grade, [John Valentin turning an unassisted triple play against us](https://www.mlb.com/video/valentin-turns-triple-play-c26377429) (also Dave on the call - man, I love hearing his voice)."]}, {"body": "It's actually the same entity.\n\nSee, Poseidon set up a DBA to be allowed to work in Rome."}, {"body": "As the proud owner of a \u201847 Braves hat; I support this amount petty."}, {"body": "The big hat is made by a company called Noggin Boss.

This is giving Ichiro the absolutely best case comparison and excluding 2 of Lofton's best seasons and excluding his superior decline phase.\n\nOffensively how do they stack up in that 10 year stretch from their age 27-36 seasons?\n\nIchiro put up a line of 331/376/430 to Lofton's 298/372/438.  WEll Lofton played in a bigger offensive era so his 110wrc+ isn't as good as Ichiro's 115wrc+ during Ichiro's best ten year stretch.\n\nWell Ichiro was great in the field so that gives him a big boost!\n\nNot at all.  Lofton was the better defender by both UZR from Fangraphs and DRS with baseball reference over Ichiro's peak.  Lofton put up 100.5 runs saved above average through his age 27-36 seasons while Ichiro put up 67.8.  This one is probably biased a bit for Lofton due to Lofton actually playing CF while Ichiro was in RF.  By raw stats Ichiro can appears to save more runs due to RF typically being a place for shitty defenders.  The value I used was \"normalized\" for all defenders so Ichiro is likely punished for playing a position lower on the defensive spectrum, but Lofton's performance was still amazing so it isn't like Ichiro was likely any better had he been in CF.\n\nWhat I will leave is a graph of their wOBA tracking over their same age seasons.  Lofton basically tracks as nearly the same value offensively as Ichiro over the same time of their careers, but held out a little better towards their decline.  None of this is to diminish Ichiro, but instead to show how a player like Kenny Lofton could be just as good but easily cast aside.\n\nhttps://www.fangraphs.com/players/kenny-lofton/246/comparison?position=&players=1101&page=8"}, {"body": "I bet if he was up for induction this year he'd get in.

I was overweight and the tallest kid on my 16U team, as a result I was slow as fuck. I remember hitting a ball into the gap one time on a field that had no outfield fence. For anyone else on my team it was an easy triple maybe ITP HR, for me it was barely a stand up double. \n\nHowever, if there any circumstance where I was on first with second base open and our team up by 10+ runs I would be given a steal sign even though we were bases to bases. This scenario came up pretty often because there were two or three teams in our district circuit that only had 9 players that never practiced. The truest playing for fun teams. I would ignore it most of the time because I don't want to get thrown out, even in a mercy rule game it was embarrassing. \n\nEventually my coach pulled me aside towards the end of the season and told me I can't ignore steal signs any more. I hadn't gotten a steal sign in our last couple games vs. private school teams even though one in one of them I was on first and they were pretty much giving me second for free. The last two games of the season were a double header vs the worst team in our league. They were 0-18, and had technically forfeited all their games because they didn't have 9 players to start any of their games. \n\nIt was the bottom of the 4th in game one, after an inside the park home run pushed the lead to 20+ to 0 with no outs. Their pitcher was just hucking it to the back stop he was so tired. First my best friend walked on 4 balls, immediately he was given a steal sign and was thrown out because even a ball hucked to the backstop got back to the catcher quickly. Then I walked on four pitches, after arriving at the base I immediately saw that I was given a steal sign. I told my first base coach I thought we were bases to bases, then he let it slip \"well not for you guys\". Referring to me and my two friends who were the worst players on the team, hitting in the 7,8,9 spots. \n\nIt was at this moment it clicked for me. We were sacrifices to end the games our team were winning. We were the slowest, and except for one, pretty mediocre hitters. The other guys on my team had pretty fragile egos, like commit 4 errors in an inning because they took a called three strike two years ago kind of fragile. The mercy rule couldn't happen until after 5 innings were completed, if we ended before that then the wins didn't count towards our record for state. So my coach was having us steal to end games faster.\n\nThe most fucked part is my coach eventually admitted that was his strategy after the season ended. He was afraid we would hit the daylight limit since games had to time max and could only be called early due to sundown. He was afraid the innings would go on so long that they would be called before 5 innings and we would lose a win on our record towards state playoffs. He didn't want to throw off the game of our star players so he chose us three.\n\nThat was my last season of rec baseball.

With the expansion of MLB teams in Portland, OR, and Memphis, TN, and their need for minor league teams, this will result in 24 teams being de-affiliated from Minor League Baseball.\n\n\u201cWe understand this move may cause short-term pain,\u201d MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a Zoom Press Conference, \u201cBut this move will help all of our Major League teams be able to better afford to compete at the big league level.  This will streamline the player development process, and shorten the minor league career path players need to make on the way to their Major League destination, enabling fans to see the best players in baseball sooner!\u201d  The Zoom conference did not allow the attending press to ask any questions.\n\nThe new organization of the Minor Leagues will feature Triple-A, Double-A, and Single-A, plus short-season complex training leagues at team\u2019s spring training homes and in the Dominican Republic.  In 2030 and before, there were both Class-A and Class-A Advanced levels.\n\nWhile a particular level will be eliminated, it\u2019s not clear which teams will be eliminated.  Teams at all levels are at risk, and the remaining leagues will be realigned with the chosen surviving teams.  MLB has indicated that this will be finalized by January.\n\nWhen MLB took over Minor League Baseball in 2021, they eliminated a Single-A level of baseball known as \u201cShort-Season A-Ball\u201d, de-affiliating 30 teams from minor league baseball.  MLB said they would keep baseball in all those communities by instituting summer leagues and leagues made up of players ahead of the draft, but many of those teams went bankrupt within a few years.\n\nBeginning in 2021, MLB mandated that teams\u2019 stadiums must meet certain rules, including clubhouse space, facilities for training, and changing rooms for women.  Most minor league stadiums fell short of these requirements.  MLB threatened to remove the affiliations of teams playing in sub-par facilities by 2026, and while some teams were able to build new stadiums or renovate, many were unable.  MLB extended the agreement through 2030, when all of the Minor League Affiliate Agreements were to expire.\n\nMLB negotiated the right to reduce the number of minor league players in the 2028 MiLB Collective Bargaining Agreement, and are exercising that right for the 2031 season.  This is similar to the right which the league negotiated in the first MILB CBA in 2023, where they had the right to reduce players signed by each organization from 180 to 165 players.  MLB took advantage of that right in 2025, when they eliminated the teams allowed in the Arizona and Gulf Coast Complex Leagues affiliated with each franchise from 2 to 1.  In 2026, they made a similar rule for the Dominican Republic Complex teams, although they are not included under the Collective Bargaining Agreement.\n\n\u201cCommunities that no longer have a minor league team will be able to further enjoy baseball by streaming through MLB+, with reduced blackout regions starting in 2031,\u201d Manfred proudly proclaimed."}, {"body": "Raleigh?", "replies": ["i dont think were allowed to, IIRC durham has a deal where no teams can be within 20 miles of them. its why the mudcats are in zebulon"]}, {"body": "My back yard."}, {"body": "Montreal will never get another MLB team.

Justin Verlander - 0 IP (IL - should return early May)\n3. Kodai Senga - 21.0 IP, 4.29 ERA, 97 ERA+\n4. Jose Quintana - 0 IP (IL - no timetable for return)\n5. Carlos Carrasco - 13.2 IP, 8.56 ERA, 49 ERA+ (IL, no timetable for return)\n\nScherzer and Senga have been underwhelming, but in a small sample size, so there is good reason to believe they will turn it around. Verlander and Quintana have been absolute zeros so far. Carrasco has been atrocious but it may just be that he was pitching injured. The jury\u2019s still out on him for this season.\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at how the replacements for the injured starters have been doing:\n\nDavid Peterson: 25.2 IP, 7.36 ERA, 56 ERA+\n\nTylor Megill: 25.0 IP, 3.96 ERA, 105 ERA+\n\nJose Butto: 9.2 IP, 2.79 ERA, 152 ERA+\n\nJoey Lucchesi: 7.2 IP, 0.00 ERA\n\nIt seems that the replacements have stepped up, but I believe they are merely getting lucky and are actually awful (with the exception of Lucchesi).\n\nLet\u2019s have a look at the statcast xERA for some of the starters, shall we (I\u2019ll put a star next to some of the ones who are due for some major regression in a bad way):\n\nScherzer: 4.11\n\nSenga: 5.56*\n\nPeterson: 5.49\n\nMegill: 6.49* (didn\u2019t know Patrick Corbin threw right handed!)\n\nButto: 6.57* (and they cloned him?!?)\n\nLucchesi: 4.00\n\nAt the moment, Scherzer and Lucchesi are the only healthy starting pitchers on the staff who are even MLB caliber, and both have roughly average underlying metrics.\n\nI highly doubt this abysmal performance will continue over the course of 162 games, as people will get healthy and Senga should get better with more reps, but if it does, we could be looking at a VERY expensive 75 win team.\n\nRegardless, it is quite astonishing how MLB\u2019s most expensive rotation may also be its worst, excluding whatever is going on in Oakland.", "spoiler": false, "title": "An In-Depth Look at the Mets Rotation, a 9 Figure Trainwreck", "upvote_ratio": 0.63, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/12zk34j/an_indepth_look_at_the_mets_rotation_a_9_figure/", "comments": [{"body": "I mean this is honestly pretty close to what the expectation for Senga was.

The fact you have diluted yourself into believing every team doesn't have guys who are exactly the way the guys you're complaining about from that 2016 team are is hilariously naive and stupid. And if Bryant is boring, how the hell are guys like Nico NOT boring? \n\nYou basically listed guys who were dicks for various reasons, or guys you CURRENTLY have some gripe with when that gripe did NOT exist from 15-18, and then a guy you have 0 gripes with, Bryant, you just dismissed as boring.

Many people sat in this section and they were the regulars who had been sitting there for many years and many knew each other by their first names, and nearly everybody knew each other by sight. They were not young or old, and there was nothing special about them except that they sat in this section and they were all experts on baseball. Some of the old fans who had been sitting in the section for years, who were now retired and did not have to leave in the fifth or sixth inning to go to work, brought vacuum bottles of ice water and baskets of food and large sun hats and field glasses and spent the whole day there; the women talked of their babies, or their grand-babies, or they knitted, or they just sat in the sun. If a stranger happened to push into the section, which did not occur very often, but did now and then on big games when every seat in the park was taken, the stranger, if he was baseball wise at all, would soon become aware that he had gotten into a private family picnic. Nothing was ever said to the stranger, because if he came back often enough he would become a regular. It was very obvious right away if a stranger could become a regular or not. There was one rule: if he complained about the poor view of the game, he did not belong there at all. It was not the place for the fan who was able to slip away from his office for one game and wanted a thrill every pitch.
