IMO we ended up paying for that during the WS.

He wasn't his usual self. We arguably could've put away the series much earlier & more confidently with a Bauer that didn't cut his stupid finger on a drone during the playoffs. It didn't help that Carlos Carrasco was injured in the middle of Sept RIGHT BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS, but that just magnifies how important it was that our starters be on their game and not splitting their fingers open doing dumb shit during this run.\n\n* Kluber pitched Game 1 in full form, 6-0 (W). \n* Bauer pitched in Game 2 (L) 1-5  & got taken out in the 4th after giving up 2 runs; our bullpen got leaned on again just to give us a chance to come back.

It was the first run & home run given up by Miller during the '16 post season. We were leaning on the bullpen, especially him, too much.\n* Bauer started next, but had the same issues, getting rocked for 3 runs in the 4th inning & getting taken out after 4. Bullpen stepped up, including a young Clevinger who gave Miller a break, but still, you want your starter to be at his best and to go past the 4th inning during the World Series. Cleveland loses a close game; all of Bauer's runs were the difference makers in Game 5 (L) 2-3.\n* Tomlin was called upon with 4 days rest & did not show up.

Miller would give up 2 in 2. This game was and is a classic. Rajai Davis. Rain Delay. Shaw gives up 2 in extras. We might comeback, but we didn't. Cleveland loses a classic in Game 7 (L) 7-8.\n\nIt didn't help that Carrasco was injured right before the playoffs either, but there's so many what-ifs about that run.

When Bauer was taken out with the injry our bullpen stepped up huge pitching the full game in relief for a (W), but this also meant we were leaning on them more than we should. IMO we ended up paying for that during the WS. Some unknown starter named Ryan Merritt came out of nowhere in game 5 to give the bullpen a break and got us into the World Series.\n\nBUT Bauer's injury seemed to obviously affect him in the World Series, and would be a big catalyst for allowing the Cubs to come back. He wasn't his usual self. We arguably could've put away the series much earlier & more confidently with a Bauer that didn't cut his stupid finger on a drone during the playoffs. It didn't help that Carlos Carrasco was injured in the middle of Sept RIGHT BEFORE THE PLAYOFFS, but that just magnifies how important it was that our starters be on their game and not splitting their fingers open doing dumb shit during this run.\n\n* Kluber pitched Game 1 in full form, 6-0 (W). \n* Bauer pitched in Game 2 (L) 1-5  & got taken out in the 4th after giving up 2 runs; our bullpen got leaned on again just to give us a chance to come back. We didn't.\n* Tomlin of all people gives a strong start & combines with the Bullpen to shut out the Cubs in Game 3 (W) 1-0\n* Kluber was called upon with only 3 days rest yet continued to do well in Game 4 (W) 7-2, but the Cubs got to Andrew Miller. It was the first run & home run given up by Miller during the '16 post season. We were leaning on the bullpen, especially him, too much.\n* Bauer started next, but had the same issues, getting rocked for 3 runs in the 4th inning & getting taken out after 4. Bullpen stepped up, including a young Clevinger who gave Miller a break, but still, you want your starter to be at his best and to go past the 4th inning during the World Series. Cleveland loses a close game; all of Bauer's runs were the difference makers in Game 5 (L) 2-3.\n* Tomlin was called upon with 4 days rest & did not show up. He got rocked early & Cleveland would lose Game 6 (L) 3-9.\n* Kluber would be asked to start *on only 3 days rest AGAIN*, and he'd get rocked early on giving up 4 runs in 4 innings. Miller would give up 2 in 2. This game was and is a classic. Rajai Davis. Rain Delay. Shaw gives up 2 in extras. We might comeback, but we didn't. Cleveland loses a classic in Game 7 (L) 7-8.\n\nIt didn't help that Carrasco was injured right before the playoffs either, but there's so many what-ifs about that run. Leaning on Miller too much, the rain delay, etc. We were so fucking close and Bauer cuts his fucking finger fiddling with a fucking drone in the middle of a run to the world series then loses the 2 games he started in them god dammit.

His poignant remarks shamefully translate seamlessly into the current day. An exerpt:\n>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\n\n>I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\n\n\n>In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: \"All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.\" Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.", "BLM have got to find a way to persuade reasonable people in the center, like me!\n\n(sports are off limits tho)", "See I WAS a progressive, but someone called me a mean name on Twitter so now I have fundamentally  changed my beliefs on who deserves to be treated like a human being and who doesn\u2019t", "[deleted]", "\"How dare a systemic problem I've been ignoring affect *me* in some way?!\"", "Fans aren't the only target though.

On the cynical end, they do things because they need to do them to get elected.

His poignant remarks shamefully translate seamlessly into the current day. An exerpt:\n>I must make two honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to \"order\" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \"I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\"; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a \"more convenient season.\" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.\n\n\n>I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.\n\n\n>In your statement you assert that our actions, even though peaceful, must be condemned because they precipitate violence. But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God consciousness and never ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber. I had also hoped that the white moderate would reject the myth concerning time in relation to the struggle for freedom. I have just received a letter from a white brother in Texas. He writes: \"All Christians know that the colored people will receive equal rights eventually, but it is possible that you are in too great a religious hurry. It has taken Christianity almost two thousand years to accomplish what it has. The teachings of Christ take time to come to earth.\" Such an attitude stems from a tragic misconception of time, from the strangely irrational notion that there is something in the very flow of time that will inevitably cure all ills. Actually, time itself is neutral; it can be used either destructively or constructively. More and more I feel that the people of ill will have used time much more effectively than have the people of good will. We will have to repent in this generation not merely for the hateful words and actions of the bad people but for the appalling silence of the good people. Human progress never rolls in on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co workers with God, and without this hard work, time itself becomes an ally of the forces of social stagnation. We must use time creatively, in the knowledge that the time is always ripe to do right. Now is the time to make real the promise of democracy and transform our pending national elegy into a creative psalm of brotherhood. Now is the time to lift our national policy from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of human dignity.", "replies": ["As you said, this 57 year old letter is thoroughly and disappointingly relevant today.", "Letter From Birmingham Jail should be required reading for everyone.

Some have asked: \"Why didn't you give the new city administration time to act?\" The only answer that I can give to this query is that the new Birmingham administration must be prodded about as much as the outgoing one, before it will act. We are sadly mistaken if we feel that the election of Albert Boutwell as mayor will bring the millennium to Birmingham. While Mr. Boutwell is a much more gentle person than Mr. Connor, they are both segregationists, dedicated to maintenance of the status quo. I have hope that Mr. Boutwell will be reasonable enough to see the futility of massive resistance to desegregation. But he will not see this without pressure from devotees of civil rights. My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\n\n> We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\"", "IIRC the immediate thing MLK was responding to was an open letter published by some white pastors who were nominal allies of the civil rights movement, but didn't like some of the confrontational/activist tactics, like sit-ins at segregated diners etc."]}, {"body": "Where in all that did MLK say to burn cities because rapists got shot for refusing to drop knives they were threatening their prior victims with?\n\nMLK never attended a riot.

My friends, I must say to you that we have not made a single gain in civil rights without determined legal and nonviolent pressure. Lamentably, it is an historical fact that privileged groups seldom give up their privileges voluntarily. Individuals may see the moral light and voluntarily give up their unjust posture; but, as Reinhold Niebuhr has reminded us, groups tend to be more immoral than individuals.\n\n> We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.

The money is a secondary reason. Ethics being the tertiary reason.\n\nAnd regardless, I vote to raise my own taxes every chance I get, when was the last time you did that? I am 100% in favor of raising my taxes if it improves police training and the crop of individuals attracted to such a position. Most people who suck on cop boots are not in favor of raising their taxes to fix policing.\n\nAnd it's laughable that you think your ethics course was at a higher standard than mine when the only thing you deal with is money. A miscalculation on your part will not result in death, but it will for me. Both money and lives are on the line when I make decisions as an engineer, unlike you. If a blueprint comes across my desk and I sign off on it without reading through every inch of it, someone could die and their blood would be on my hands. And I was told that if I am not prepared to inspect every single aspect of a blueprint that I am asked to sign off on, then I should not accept the responsibility of being a professional engineer. This ties back into what I said is the number one reason I would never sign up to be a cop and why I criticize those who sign up to be a cop and place their own well being before the creed of the position they are accepting: I am not willing to risk my life to be a cop correctly, thus I would refuse to apply or accept a position which would put others in harms way due to my own selfish inclinations. Just like I was taught in my ethics course and upbringing.\n\nAnd who gives a shit if you make more? What does that even matter? Where did I mention that I wanted to know or that this was a competition? As I said, my contribution to society is greater as an engineer at Tesla than it would be as a cop and, as a secondary reason to continue my line of work, so is my compensation. \n\nGet a grip."]}, {"body": "Can't argue with that but that's what people have been asking for all summer and it's not working", "replies": ["All summer?

So as to better understand politics as you see it, how would you define it, given that it has meaning beyond government affairs? And how does personal attachment and value make something political? As an example outside of sports, take me liking cooking and camping. Sure, there are political elements to both if you want to extract them: the ethics of the farmers who grow my food, GMOs, national parks, etc., but I am having trouble understanding how that makes it so political. Granted, these are less immediate issues on the plate of the American public than others, which have been highlighted in 2020. So, there is meaning in the sport. There is personal attachment. I love the sport, from having played it to watching it, and so much more. Yes. There is history to it, one of failure and triumph, absolutely. The players are people with their own backgrounds and opinions. Clearly. Now, what does it have to do with government affairs? Sorry if this seems unclear. I'm not sure how to express everything I'm thinking here. Thanks for the patience. In short though, how does personal make political?", "replies": ["To be political, by definition, is to be somehow involved or associated with ideas, decisions, or any other forms of power relations between individuals. In other words, it's the push, pull, and reality of who's in charge and what they're doing to stay there. Obviously this makes \"politics\" an extremely broad term, and multi-faceted, which is why it's so far-reaching. \n\nCooking is definitely extremely political and is one of the easiest examples in my opinion. The cultural dishes of different areas are defined by their history \u2013 for example, you could compare the relatively complex French cuisine, which requires a higher number of tools, equipment, and refined ingredients, to that of Central American cuisine, which is largely based on maximizing cheap and readily available ingredients with little more than a basic heat source and working hands. France is an historically wealthy nation where involved food preparation is a luxury many can afford, while that's not the case in much of Central America. Their cooking cultures have evolved accordingly. This is just one example but there are so many more, just google \"politics in cooking\" and tons of stuff will pop up.\n\nAs far as how being personal makes sports political, I'm not sure how to reduce it down any further than I did in my original comment really. It just comes down to the reality that sports are made of their players, and players are people with their own lives which are invariably defined by the politics around them. It's impossible to separate someone professionally from who they are personally, because who they are in any aspect of their life is the result of their upbringing and the political foundations they were shaped by. What kind of school you go to, what kind of obstacles your family faces, what experience you have as a result of your skin color, the career paths you're pressured into or away from \u2013 all of these things are strongly affected by politics around us, and they build the foundations of who we are. \n\nFor baseball players, it helps shape them as players in a highly-politicized league. How could anyone possibly argue that baseball, which is nicknamed \"America's pastime\" begins every game with the national anthem, isn't political? If you were a black player from a community where you frequently witnessed police brutality or had multiple loved ones unjustly condemned to a failed justice system, would you be able to separate that part of yourself when you see a Senator who backs police militarization throwing out the first pitch? If you were the son Dominican refugees who were treated like criminals your entire life, would you be able to put that past away when white baseball fans suddenly treat you well because you're wearing their team's jersey?

France is an historically wealthy nation where involved food preparation is a luxury many can afford, while that's not the case in much of Central America. Their cooking cultures have evolved accordingly.

It just comes down to the reality that sports are made of their players, and players are people with their own lives which are invariably defined by the politics around them. It's impossible to separate someone professionally from who they are personally, because who they are in any aspect of their life is the result of their upbringing and the political foundations they were shaped by. What kind of school you go to, what kind of obstacles your family faces, what experience you have as a result of your skin color, the career paths you're pressured into or away from \u2013 all of these things are strongly affected by politics around us, and they build the foundations of who we are. \n\nFor baseball players, it helps shape them as players in a highly-politicized league. How could anyone possibly argue that baseball, which is nicknamed \"America's pastime\" begins every game with the national anthem, isn't political?

People wanting consequences for others bad actions is not new. But that is also not what cancel culture is.

Thank you. \n\nSince im a red sox fan, [This](https://youtu.be/ZTnZO5H-kAY) is the obligatory video of him striking out in the 2018 world series which sealed the victory and championship for boston. His strikeout was the final out. Actually made him buckle at the knee and fall down.\n\nThe slide against Pedroia that pretty much ruined the rest of his career by machado - https://youtu.be/ZTnZO5H-kAY\n\nFirst link that popped up after googling \"Machado dirty player\". https://youtu.be/DYTSt9sAdrk\n\nPlayers looking to injure someone on the other team is low class af, and those players almost always get \"notified\" of their bitch ass play style. Football has its way, baseball has their way, and hockey has a really fun way to \"notify\" players who play dirty.\n\nMy favorite example of a guy who played the game the right way is Nolan Ryan. In a game in 1993 he was pitching against the white sox, and ventura was having a good night batting. When he came up to bat for the third time, Ryan took away all really hittable pitches as pitchers do, and started working the inside of the plate. A ball got away from him, and hit Ventura on the back shoulder. \n\nIt was an honest mistake, but Ventura pulled a Machado and disregarded those unwritten rules of baseball and decided to charge the mound upon which a 46-year-old Nolan Ryan was on. He was quickly educated as ryan got him in a headlock and started beating the shit out of him. Like a Father whoops his sons ass. \n\nStill one of my favorite baseball moments. https://youtu.be/R3niGu9d_pY\n\n\ntl;dr - Manny Machado is a peice of shit ballplayer, cheap and dirty, and will never get the respect other professional athletes get. Hes a dirty player, and I sorta wish Nolan Ryan was still around to dish out a texas sized can of whoop ass on him like he did ventura."}, {"body": "How he\u2019s doing this year?

McGwire did not hit his 70th home run in game 163 (there was no game 163).\n\n\\------------\n\nSammy Sosa did get to play 163 games in 1998.  His 66th home run came in game 161. [https://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=199809250HOU](https://www.baseball-almanac.com/box-scores/boxscore.php?boxid=199809250HOU)\n\n\\------\n\nIn 1999 and 2001 (the other 60+ HR seasons), the Cubs, Giants, and Cardinals all played 162.\n\n**No player has ever gotten an extra game that mattered.**", "replies": ["It's unfortunate that you seem to have tried doing some research and still wound up with the impression that you did. You're incorrect, especially about your last statement that \"no player has ever gotten an extra game that mattered.\"\n\nIf a game was called early due to weather or other factors, and the game was tied after the fifth inning, then it was considered a tie, and replayed in its entirety. *All stats collected in that game count.* This means that for the players on that team, there are more than 162 games in that season. If a player appeared in every game that season, they are credited with more than 162 games played. A number of players (like, a [*lot*](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/G_season.shtml)) over the years have accomplished this, with the extreme example of Ron Santo, who in 1965 earned 164 games played (Cubs' record: 72-90, with 2 ties).\n\n[1961 Yankees](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1961-schedule-scores.shtml)  \n163 games were played. The second game of the doubleheader on April 22 ended in a tie, necessitating an extra game against Baltimore. The player stats count for the tied game. As it happens, Maris played in that tied game but didn't homer. He *did* homer in the final game of the season, which was the 163rd game the Yankees played...or, if you prefer, the 163rd game in which a Yankee player could earn stats.\n\nIn common conversation, Maris' season is referred to as a 162-game season because that's what it was *supposed* to be. It's a technicality, and a somewhat intriguing bit of trivia, that he in fact got one more game.\n\n[1998 Cardinals](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1998-schedule-scores.shtml)  \nAgain, 163 games were played, due to a game on August 24 which ended in a tie. McGwire didn't play in that game, but if he had, his stats would have counted. He did play in the final game of the season, and that's when he hit his final two homers. It was the 163rd game the Cards played that year...or, more to the point, the 163rd game in which McGwire could have hit a home run.\n\nThis is why I have calculated the pace of these seasons over 163 games: regardless of whether the players themselves actually appeared in every game, *they had the opportunity to do so,* just as Judge and the others are calculated over 162 for the total opportunities they had in their normal seasons. The pace more accurately reflects the expectations of the player's performance in the season that played out for them.

You're incorrect, especially about your last statement that \"no player has ever gotten an extra game that mattered.\"\n\nIf a game was called early due to weather or other factors, and the game was tied after the fifth inning, then it was considered a tie, and replayed in its entirety. *All stats collected in that game count.* This means that for the players on that team, there are more than 162 games in that season. If a player appeared in every game that season, they are credited with more than 162 games played. A number of players (like, a [*lot*](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/G_season.shtml)) over the years have accomplished this, with the extreme example of Ron Santo, who in 1965 earned 164 games played (Cubs' record: 72-90, with 2 ties).\n\n[1961 Yankees](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/NYY/1961-schedule-scores.shtml)  \n163 games were played. The second game of the doubleheader on April 22 ended in a tie, necessitating an extra game against Baltimore. The player stats count for the tied game. As it happens, Maris played in that tied game but didn't homer. He *did* homer in the final game of the season, which was the 163rd game the Yankees played...or, if you prefer, the 163rd game in which a Yankee player could earn stats.\n\nIn common conversation, Maris' season is referred to as a 162-game season because that's what it was *supposed* to be. It's a technicality, and a somewhat intriguing bit of trivia, that he in fact got one more game.\n\n[1998 Cardinals](https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/1998-schedule-scores.shtml)  \nAgain, 163 games were played, due to a game on August 24 which ended in a tie. McGwire didn't play in that game, but if he had, his stats would have counted. He did play in the final game of the season, and that's when he hit his final two homers. It was the 163rd game the Cards played that year...or, more to the point, the 163rd game in which McGwire could have hit a home run.\n\nThis is why I have calculated the pace of these seasons over 163 games: regardless of whether the players themselves actually appeared in every game, *they had the opportunity to do so,* just as Judge and the others are calculated over 162 for the total opportunities they had in their normal seasons.

Rays down by one. Brett Phillips (the batter) is up to bat. Runners on second and first, so the Rays would love a base hit so that the runner from second can score and tie the game. Problem is that the Phillips is nowhere near being one the Rays best players. He\u2019s a defensive/pinch-runner late inning substitution the Rays only put in during the 8th or 9th. He rarely gets to bat. He\u2019s never had a postseason hit and his last hit in general (regular season) was about a month ago.\n\nAgain there are two runners on base, but there are two outs and the count is 1-2 which means that the Dodgers just need one more out to win the game. They would just need one more strike to be thrown to win.\n\nPhillips gets the hit. Runner on second scores to tie the game. Cool. Now comes the interesting part. You see the outfielder bobble it when he\u2019s fielding the hit, so the Rays decide to send home the runner who was on first base. If that runner can score, the Rays win the ballgame because it\u2019s the 9th inning and the Rays are the home team. They would walk it off.\n\nHowever, as that runner is running towards home, he trips and falls. While he\u2019s been running the Dodgers started a relay. The outfielder threw it to the relay man and that relay man is gonna throw it to the catcher at home to tag that runner. Because the runner fell, the Dodgers should have him tagged out easily. The throw beat him easily because he fell and that shouldve been the third out and then the games would go into extras. However the catcher missed it and the runner got to score and the Rays won.\n\nAs for why the catcher missed it, it was because he didn\u2019t know the runner fell and he thought the runner was close to home and that the play was gonna be super close so he was trying to start the tag while catching the ball. Kinda panicking because he thought it was gonna be a close play.\n\nSeems like his fault but there are other people to consider to imo. If the outfielder fields it cleanly, we probably avoid this whole situation at all because they Rays wouldn\u2019t have sent the runner. The relay man, while it wasn\u2019t the worst throw, it definitely would\u2019ve helped if he threw it to the third base side. The pitcher, who was just standing in front of home, should have been backing up the catcher in case he missed it, which is exactly what happened.

Q: Is this the correct position for the pitcher here? Seems kind of odd.\n\n5) The winning runner stumbles on the basepaths, should likely be tagged out because of it.\n\n6) Relay throw to the catcher is off the mark. Catcher attempts to catch the ball and tag the runner at the same time, but the runner isn't there because of the stumble. Q: Had the runner been there, would he be out? What if the ball pops out of the catcher's mitt after applying the tag? Also, should the pitcher not have thrown it to the third baseman who then should have tried to tag out the stumbled baserunner?\n\n7) The ball gets away from the catcher, allowing the runner to score and walk-off the game as the fielders try to recover the ball.\n\nDid I get all of this correct?\n\nI'm also reading things about that the catcher should have removed his mask at some point, and that someone didn't back up the catcher correctly.

That's the first baseman actually, and it's normal for players to move away from their positions in order to deal with situations like this. It didn't happen here but it's common for there to be situations where the first baseman needs to field a ball and the pitcher runs to first to cover the bag.\n\n5. Yep\n\n6. He would almost certainly have been out. As long as he's tagged with the ball it doesn't matter what happens after.\n\n7. Yep\n\nThis isn't in the clip but something that makes this whole thing crazier is Arozarena actually falls over while he's running home, and if he hadn't he would have been safe regardless of whether the catcher screwed up.", "Basically yes! Except gettingg the batter out on a ball hit to the of is like a 0.0001% chance and this one never would have been an out, just should have only been 1 run", "Yeah, that's mostly correct.  To answer your questions:\n\nIf the outfielder had fielded it cleanly, there's no way he would have been able to throw out the runner at first, but he may have had a play at the plate.  Still, one run likely would have scored (with two outs, runners are going to run as soon as there is contact because they don't need to worry about getting caught in a double play).  The second run, though, was entirely because of the Dodgers fuck ups.\n\nThat wasn't the pitcher that did the relay throw.  Cut-off throws like that are normal, but with the outfielder that shallow, he should have been able to throw directly to home plate.  Still, cutting it off was the right move because the the throw was off line.  Still, the relay throw was also bad.  In general a fielder will stand between the outfielder and the intended target and cut off the throw if it doesn't look like it's going to make it to the target cleanly.\n\nI don't think the catcher ever really had the ball, so i think the runner would have been safe if he hadn't stumbled and had been tagged, but it's really hard to see from that angle.  If the ball popped out after the tag and the catcher clearly had it before, that would be an out.  \n\n\nEDIT: actually, after watching it again, I don't think the cut-off was necessary.  The throw from the outfielder was good enough."]}, {"body": "Sorry to ask since i\u2019m kinda new to baseball but what happened to the guy at home plate?

It bounced off his glove and out of frame, I think between the umps legs.  It was a bad play all around.  The throw was on the wrong side of the plate, but the catcher had plenty of time to catch it and come back for the tag (in fact, if he had caught it, the runner probably would have tried to get back to third and been caught in a rundown).  Instead, he thought the play would be much closer and rushed the tag before he had actually caught the ball.  That's what the 360 was.", "Tagging the base doesn't get the out unless the runner is forced to run by another runner behind him, the runner on first is forced to go if someone gets a hit, the runner on second is forced to go if someone is on first and there's a hit, etc. There was only a runner on second when Arozarena was running home so tagging the base doesn't get a forced out, in order to get him out he needs to be physically tagged."]}, {"body": "*THIS* is peak world series baseball right here. \n\n What a beautiful game"}, {"body": "Probably one of the best sports moments I got to watch live.

Obviously, this does not happen. First runner scores uncontested. While the fielder is recovering the ball, the second runner takes advantage by trying to score. Off screen, he trips and falls. The fielder recovers the ball and throws to home plate. Because the runner fell, there's a good chance that the ball will reach the guy at home plate before the runner scores, and the guy at home plate can touch the runner with the ball in his glove, resulting in an \"out\" (which would send the tied game into extra innings). Obviously, this does not happen. The ball is thrown to home by the fielder, but it could use some help getting there so it is \"relayed\" by another player to get it there quicker. This player doesn't make a horrible throw, but it forces the guy at the plate to reach back behind himself to catch the ball. This guy at the plate has been focused on catching the ball, so he hasn't realized that the runner fell. He expects the runner to be near home plate and that he will have to quickly touch the runner with the ball to stop the runner from scoring. He gets ahead of himself and never secures the catch.

However, the outfielder who goes to make the catch drops the ball allowing for two players to move into score. The second player attempting to score trips and the outfielder throws to home, which would eliminate the him, but he also drops the ball. The player who tripped then proceeds to score and wins the game since this is the final at bat of the game.", "It\u2019s the 9th inning (last inning). Rays down by one. Brett Phillips (the batter) is up to bat. Runners on second and first, so the Rays would love a base hit so that the runner from second can score and tie the game. Problem is that the Phillips is nowhere near being one the Rays best players. He\u2019s a defensive/pinch-runner late inning substitution the Rays only put in during the 8th or 9th. He rarely gets to bat. He\u2019s never had a postseason hit and his last hit in general (regular season) was about a month ago.\n\nAgain there are two runners on base, but there are two outs and the count is 1-2 which means that the Dodgers just need one more out to win the game. They would just need one more strike to be thrown to win.\n\nPhillips gets the hit. Runner on second scores to tie the game. Cool. Now comes the interesting part. You see the outfielder bobble it when he\u2019s fielding the hit, so the Rays decide to send home the runner who was on first base. If that runner can score, the Rays win the ballgame because it\u2019s the 9th inning and the Rays are the home team. They would walk it off.\n\nHowever, as that runner is running towards home, he trips and falls. While he\u2019s been running the Dodgers started a relay. The outfielder threw it to the relay man and that relay man is gonna throw it to the catcher at home to tag that runner. Because the runner fell, the Dodgers should have him tagged out easily. The throw beat him easily because he fell and that shouldve been the third out and then the games would go into extras. However the catcher missed it and the runner got to score and the Rays won.\n\nAs for why the catcher missed it, it was because he didn\u2019t know the runner fell and he thought the runner was close to home and that the play was gonna be super close so he was trying to start the tag while catching the ball. Kinda panicking because he thought it was gonna be a close play.\n\nSeems like his fault but there are other people to consider to imo. If the outfielder fields it cleanly, we probably avoid this whole situation at all because they Rays wouldn\u2019t have sent the runner. The relay man, while it wasn\u2019t the worst throw, it definitely would\u2019ve helped if he threw it to the third base side. The pitcher, who was just standing in front of home, should have been backing up the catcher in case he missed it, which is exactly what happened. And I feel like he should have been telling the catcher that the runner tripped and that there was no need to rush a tag and to focus on just catching the ball.\n\nSorry for the long reply. I just find it so cool how a game can change favors so quickly.

Rays down by one. Brett Phillips (the batter) is up to bat. Runners on second and first, so the Rays would love a base hit so that the runner from second can score and tie the game. Problem is that the Phillips is nowhere near being one the Rays best players. He\u2019s a defensive/pinch-runner late inning substitution the Rays only put in during the 8th or 9th. He rarely gets to bat. He\u2019s never had a postseason hit and his last hit in general (regular season) was about a month ago.\n\nAgain there are two runners on base, but there are two outs and the count is 1-2 which means that the Dodgers just need one more out to win the game. They would just need one more strike to be thrown to win.\n\nPhillips gets the hit. Runner on second scores to tie the game. Cool. Now comes the interesting part. You see the outfielder bobble it when he\u2019s fielding the hit, so the Rays decide to send home the runner who was on first base. If that runner can score, the Rays win the ballgame because it\u2019s the 9th inning and the Rays are the home team. They would walk it off.\n\nHowever, as that runner is running towards home, he trips and falls. While he\u2019s been running the Dodgers started a relay. The outfielder threw it to the relay man and that relay man is gonna throw it to the catcher at home to tag that runner. Because the runner fell, the Dodgers should have him tagged out easily. The throw beat him easily because he fell and that shouldve been the third out and then the games would go into extras. However the catcher missed it and the runner got to score and the Rays won.\n\nAs for why the catcher missed it, it was because he didn\u2019t know the runner fell and he thought the runner was close to home and that the play was gonna be super close so he was trying to start the tag while catching the ball. Kinda panicking because he thought it was gonna be a close play.\n\nSeems like his fault but there are other people to consider to imo. If the outfielder fields it cleanly, we probably avoid this whole situation at all because they Rays wouldn\u2019t have sent the runner. The relay man, while it wasn\u2019t the worst throw, it definitely would\u2019ve helped if he threw it to the third base side. The pitcher, who was just standing in front of home, should have been backing up the catcher in case he missed it, which is exactly what happened. And I feel like he should have been telling the catcher that the runner tripped and that there was no need to rush a tag and to focus on just catching the ball.\n\nSorry for the long reply. I just find it so cool how a game can change favors so quickly. The Dodgers were ONE pitch away from going up 3-1 in the series and in the span of 15 seconds, the Rays has this crazy play to end the game and tie the series at 2 apiece.", "replies": ["Thank you!

Cut-off throws like that are normal, but with the outfielder that shallow, he should have been able to throw directly to home plate.  Still, cutting it off was the right move because the the throw was off line.  Still, the relay throw was also bad.  In general a fielder will stand between the outfielder and the intended target and cut off the throw if it doesn't look like it's going to make it to the target cleanly.\n\nI don't think the catcher ever really had the ball, so i think the runner would have been safe if he hadn't stumbled and had been tagged, but it's really hard to see from that angle.

The fielder muffed the ball, so the runner originally on first base tried to score the winning run, but he tripped halfway between third base and home.

The guy at bat who hits the ball hits it for a single, meaning players can advance one base which would tie the game. However, the outfielder who goes to make the catch drops the ball allowing for two players to move into score. The second player attempting to score trips and the outfielder throws to home, which would eliminate the him, but he also drops the ball. The player who tripped then proceeds to score and wins the game since this is the final at bat of the game."}, {"body": "It\u2019s the 9th inning (last inning). Rays down by one. Brett Phillips (the batter) is up to bat. Runners on second and first, so the Rays would love a base hit so that the runner from second can score and tie the game. Problem is that the Phillips is nowhere near being one the Rays best players. He\u2019s a defensive/pinch-runner late inning substitution the Rays only put in during the 8th or 9th. He rarely gets to bat. He\u2019s never had a postseason hit and his last hit in general (regular season) was about a month ago.\n\nAgain there are two runners on base, but there are two outs and the count is 1-2 which means that the Dodgers just need one more out to win the game. They would just need one more strike to be thrown to win.\n\nPhillips gets the hit. Runner on second scores to tie the game. Cool. Now comes the interesting part. You see the outfielder bobble it when he\u2019s fielding the hit, so the Rays decide to send home the runner who was on first base. If that runner can score, the Rays win the ballgame because it\u2019s the 9th inning and the Rays are the home team. They would walk it off.\n\nHowever, as that runner is running towards home, he trips and falls. While he\u2019s been running the Dodgers started a relay. The outfielder threw it to the relay man and that relay man is gonna throw it to the catcher at home to tag that runner. Because the runner fell, the Dodgers should have him tagged out easily. The throw beat him easily because he fell and that shouldve been the third out and then the games would go into extras. However the catcher missed it and the runner got to score and the Rays won.\n\nAs for why the catcher missed it, it was because he didn\u2019t know the runner fell and he thought the runner was close to home and that the play was gonna be super close so he was trying to start the tag while catching the ball. Kinda panicking because he thought it was gonna be a close play.\n\nSeems like his fault but there are other people to consider to imo. If the outfielder fields it cleanly, we probably avoid this whole situation at all because they Rays wouldn\u2019t have sent the runner. The relay man, while it wasn\u2019t the worst throw, it definitely would\u2019ve helped if he threw it to the third base side. The pitcher, who was just standing in front of home, should have been backing up the catcher in case he missed it, which is exactly what happened. And I feel like he should have been telling the catcher that the runner tripped and that there was no need to rush a tag and to focus on just catching the ball.\n\nSorry for the long reply. I just find it so cool how a game can change favors so quickly. The Dodgers were ONE pitch away from going up 3-1 in the series and in the span of 15 seconds, the Rays has this crazy play to end the game and tie the series at 2 apiece."}, {"body": "Now all the pressure is on playoff kershaw to not let the series go down 3-2"}, {"body": "The second guy to score tripped somewhere between third base and home\n\nBasically, the Rays are down one run, with the tying run on second base, and the winning run on first.

So rather than conditioning the ball, pitchers condition their hands with typically tacky substances, to get extra levels of grip, through which they can achieve better control of the ball (better grip can lead to more spin which means more movement). This is actually illegal according to the laws of the game, but it has been rarely enforced unless it is flagrant. Players have took this grey area and stretched it past breaking point (using ludicrous substances such as construction adhesives) to where the league has done a reactionary move to have the umpires start checking players for foreign substances located on gloves, hats, belts etc despite the league saying they were not going to make such a move during the season."]}, {"body": "I don't know anything about sports.

It's been a common assumption that all pitchers are cheating to some extent for years, but has moved to the forefront recently because it's been better quantified scientifically just how much more effective certain substances make pitchers.  The league doesn't want offense to get bogged down for the sake of the entertainment value so a week or 2 ago, they initiated umpires randomly checking pitchers for illegal substances.  The announcers in this video say the pitcher, Max Scherzer (\"sure-zer\") was already checked twice between innings and was clean, but now, in the middle of the inning, the opposing manager asked the umps to check him again, very likely as an icing tactic, to get Scherzer out of his rhythm.  Scherzer and his manager took exception to this because it's pretty underhanded, especially since he'd already been checked twice.  That's why Scherzer was waving his hat and hand from the dugout after the inning.  He was saying, \"See I'm clean.

It\u2019s heavy enough and light enough to be thrown and hit the way it\u2019s thrown and hit. But more important to this conversation are the laces. One, it\u2019s sewn together to allow the particular components to be inside it. Two, it allows for grip to throw. Three, the laces interact with the air to allow pitchers to throw different kinds of pitches, e.g., curve balls, sliders, knuckle balls, etc. These types of pitchers make the balls do funny things and adds to the skill required to be a versatile pitcher, and challenge of being a successful batter. At the level of play in MLB, pitchers could throw it straight down the line with near perfect accuracy near every time. That\u2019s not why balls go wide or wild, for the most part. Balls thrown miss the strike zone for either strategic reasons or because the pitcher threw a challenging pitch, like a curve ball, that didn\u2019t quite hit its mark.\n\nPart of the dance between batters and pitchers though is the ability to know what the ball is going to do based on the normal aerodynamic physics at play.\n\nBut grease and other substances allow you to throw a ball differently than it should behave. It alters the surface of the ball and it operates against the predictable aerodynamics of the ball trajectory allowing for unearned difficulty in the pitch and near impossible ball behavior.\n\nThis pitcher is being challenged for the fact that he\u2019s throwing a no hitter\u2026 meaning no one, thus far, has gotten on base by the other team. Many in the thread recognize the problems with using substances but are concerned with the ability for one team to just be able to stop the flow and momentum of the other team, especially one winning or during a close game or on a hot streak of no hitters, mid-inning.

It's been a common assumption that all pitchers are cheating to some extent for years, but has moved to the forefront recently because it's been better quantified scientifically just how much more effective certain substances make pitchers.  The league doesn't want offense to get bogged down for the sake of the entertainment value so a week or 2 ago, they initiated umpires randomly checking pitchers for illegal substances.  The announcers in this video say the pitcher, Max Scherzer (\"sure-zer\") was already checked twice between innings and was clean, but now, in the middle of the inning, the opposing manager asked the umps to check him again, very likely as an icing tactic, to get Scherzer out of his rhythm.  Scherzer and his manager took exception to this because it's pretty underhanded, especially since he'd already been checked twice.  That's why Scherzer was waving his hat and hand from the dugout after the inning.  He was saying, \"See I'm clean.  No sticky stuff.\"\n\nAlso Mad Max is probably the most intense pitcher currently in MLB, so rising him up was definitely going to get some interesting results.", "replies": ["Let the opposing coach call for a substance check, but if it comes up empty give opposing team some kind of delay of game penalty.

It\u2019s heavy enough and light enough to be thrown and hit the way it\u2019s thrown and hit. But more important to this conversation are the laces. One, it\u2019s sewn together to allow the particular components to be inside it. Two, it allows for grip to throw. Three, the laces interact with the air to allow pitchers to throw different kinds of pitches, e.g., curve balls, sliders, knuckle balls, etc. These types of pitchers make the balls do funny things and adds to the skill required to be a versatile pitcher, and challenge of being a successful batter. At the level of play in MLB, pitchers could throw it straight down the line with near perfect accuracy near every time. That\u2019s not why balls go wide or wild, for the most part. Balls thrown miss the strike zone for either strategic reasons or because the pitcher threw a challenging pitch, like a curve ball, that didn\u2019t quite hit its mark.\n\nPart of the dance between batters and pitchers though is the ability to know what the ball is going to do based on the normal aerodynamic physics at play.\n\nBut grease and other substances allow you to throw a ball differently than it should behave. It alters the surface of the ball and it operates against the predictable aerodynamics of the ball trajectory allowing for unearned difficulty in the pitch and near impossible ball behavior.\n\nThis pitcher is being challenged for the fact that he\u2019s throwing a no hitter\u2026 meaning no one, thus far, has gotten on base by the other team.

Therefore better grip and faster spin will make a fastball fly straighter, and a curveball curve more. It doesn't have to move the ball much in order for it to make the batter misjudge the trajectory of the ball and swing over or under the ball.\n2. It can give a pitcher a *worse* grip, which allows them to throw with their natural motion, but let the ball slip out of their fingers at the very end, imparting very little spin at all. This allows chaotic turbulent forces to dominate, and push the ball somewhat randomly. The legal version of this is the knuckleball, which requires a somewhat modified motion and therefore is much slower than the substance-enhanced version.\n\nIn the modern game, #1 is much more common, because it's a subtle improvement on the way the pitcher would already be throwing, as opposed to #2 which is a completely different style of pitch."]}, {"body": "I'd laugh if it wasn't true.", "replies": ["I hate Manfred almost as much as he hates baseball."]}, {"body": "An out awarded to the fielding team.", "replies": ["I can't imagine MLB would actually do that, but yeah, that would probably work.

I don't really like trolls in general. \nIt's definitely teasing and trolling though yea. \n\nI guess I rationalize it by how socially acceptable it is to go at another sport in America. I mean I grew up playing various sports including tennis and soccer which definitely didn't feel as well funded or respected as football and baseball. Perhaps lots of it stems from that childhood jealously. \n\nBut then again I'm a mountain biker these days and definitely never miss a chance to poke fun at a road bikers (can you blame me? The skin tight spandex, the desire to ride along cars instead of in nature, the super expensive gear, the obstacles to traffic)\nSo perhaps making fun of things other people enjoy has more to do with my present nature. \n\n Baseball is kinda an easy target too. Declining sport with a rich history, rife with controversy over drug abuse, and had troubled history with racism framed as a success story. It is very much like it's country. Successful, declining, still popular but resistant to change."}]}
