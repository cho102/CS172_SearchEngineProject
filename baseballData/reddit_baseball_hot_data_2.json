The model also includes \u201caxis differential,\u201d a statistic that attempts to describe the difference between the movement expected by spin alone and the observed movement affected by the phenomenon described as seam-shifted wake.\n\nStuff+ was trained against run values, so even if the research community is divided about how much a pitcher can control weak contact, the model includes an inherent nod to the possibility that they do possess some of that ability. The importance of release point in the model also suggests that Stuff+ includes some deception \u2014 you\u2019ll find some pitchers with unique release point and movement combinations score very well despite lower velocities, at least. Vertical attack angle is not explicitly in the model, but it is captured by the interaction between release points and movement.\nGenerally, the model aims to capture the \u201cnastiest\u201d pitches in baseball, using a decision tree-based model to capture the nonlinear relationships that exist across release points, velocities, pitch movement, and more.\n\nhttps://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/stuff-location-and-pitching-primer/\n\nfancy modeling done to compare pitches to other similar pitches"]}, {"body": "All I\u2019m seeing is Kikuchi\u2019s fastball+ higher than Shohei\u2019s, goodenuff for me"}, {"body": "This is misleading, doesn't include this+, that+, or those+"}, {"body": "Jake having 4 pitches that are that good is just unfair.

The model also includes \u201caxis differential,\u201d a statistic that attempts to describe the difference between the movement expected by spin alone and the observed movement affected by the phenomenon described as seam-shifted wake.\n\nStuff+ was trained against run values, so even if the research community is divided about how much a pitcher can control weak contact, the model includes an inherent nod to the possibility that they do possess some of that ability. The importance of release point in the model also suggests that Stuff+ includes some deception \u2014 you\u2019ll find some pitchers with unique release point and movement combinations score very well despite lower velocities, at least. Vertical attack angle is not explicitly in the model, but it is captured by the interaction between release points and movement.\nGenerally, the model aims to capture the \u201cnastiest\u201d pitches in baseball, using a decision tree-based model to capture the nonlinear relationships that exist across release points, velocities, pitch movement, and more.\n\nhttps://library.fangraphs.com/pitching/stuff-location-and-pitching-primer/\n\nfancy modeling done to compare pitches to other similar pitches"}, {"body": "For starting pitchers, the average stuff+ is 95."}, {"body": "I don\u2019t think underrated at all.

And it looks a lot worse when there's a man of glass in Stanton that is getting 3x as much while hardly playing and and when he does, not ever playing the field.\n\nSo bWAR and fWAR roughly agree on Hicks' value in 2022, so I went and found a 4th outfielder who had vaguely similar production last year and is a 4th outfielder this year, and found, funny enough, Max Kepler of the Twins. He had a great season a few years ago, is getting paid $8.5MM this year, and last year played in 100+ games but hitting ~450 PAs.\n\nObviously in limited time this year, Hicks has been one of the worst hitters in baseball, but as a 4th outfielder coming into the season, he was almost exactly the same as Max Kepler. In fact, Kepler is kind of playing the same role with other noted man-of-glass Byron Buxton.\n\nWhich is all a very roundabout way of saying that while Hicks is overpaid and fairly 'cooked', if he doesn't get a pile of injuries and have a need to be a bigger piece due to other injuries, he's probably not seen nearly as badly.\n\nOn top of that, correct me if I'm wrong, but Hicks was one of the primary 'faces' of the Yankees' Judge-excepted collapse last year, but he wasn't really that bad.\n\nHis contract began in 2019, and at a very conservative estimate of $4MM/WAR, here's how his seasons stack up:\n\n* 2019: 1.3 (~3 WAR if he played ~130 games)\n* 2020: 0.7 (~1.8 WAR if he played ~130 games)\n* 2021: Yeah this season was a lost cause with comical injury and bad\n* 2022: 1.6 WAR (in ~130 games)\n\nSo he's paid roughly fair value if he weren't constantly injured, but his career peaking in 2018/2019 tracks and he's actually had a fairly consistent slide downward, injuries notwithstanding.\n\nHonestly, as far as 'bad' contracts go, 7/70 isn't a horrible gamble. If he stayed healthy and regressed some, it'd be fine, and if he was hurt but stayed great, it'd be fine. Instead he was an average-ish bat that was decimated by injuries in 2 of his 3 'best' seasons of the contract.\n\nIf he plays a full 2019 and 2021, I think his contract looks a lot better.

THE WHITE SOX ARE BAD AT BASEBALL IN EVERY WAY!"}, {"body": "I've been a diehard Chicago White Sox fan for nearly 40 years. I say that with the very express intent of sharing my deep and undying love for this team. And my call is rooted in heartbreak, not anger. Don't get me wrong, I'm angry, but it is a byproduct of a dysfunctional, abusive relationship with the front office and the ownership of the Chicago White Sox. I also want to say I have defended this rebuild. I liked what the team did with the trade. I defended Yasmani [Grandal] and Dallas [Keuchel]. I didn't understand the La Russa hire, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. I forgave the free agents they let go. I was befuddled by the Benintendi and Clevinger signings. But you know what? I said I'm going to give them one last shot. And when they canceled Soxfest, like the cowards they are, I knew something was up. But now we know, obviously the experiment is over. The vast majority of the prospects have been busts. The product on the field is pathetic. We have exactly two players of excellence on this roster, Dylan Cease and Tim Anderson. Everyone else is nowhere near the kind of player they need to be to make this a winning team.\n\n\u200b\n\nYou'd think that would be enough to wake this organization up. But yesterday, Kenny Williams had the gall to say that he's not in a good place right now, and accountability is not an issue. You're right, he's not in a good place. He's not in a job he should have. Think about all the promises that Rick Hahn made, mired in mediocrity, that he bragged about Romy Gonz\u00e1lez in Spring Training, and I'll trade him if I get the right price. Think about the things Grifol said, \"Come to the park, we're going to kick everyone's butts.\" They must have been talking about the fans! Not the other teams. The entire lineup is batting under .220. The best hitter on the team is Jake. Burger! We're a Triple A team. Our right fielders are hitting .180 with a weighted runs created plus (wRC+) of 28! I don't even need to tell you about the pitching staff. Katz has got to go. Moncada, TA, Eloy, Yas, Joe Kelly - it's week 4! They've all already been hurt! Tens of millions of dollars on replacement level players while stars go elsewhere. We're 11 games under .500. The Bears needed six months to get 11 games under .500. We needed three weeks.\n\n\u200b\n\nIn the 15 years of Rick Hahn, we have been a constant experiment that has never panned out. In the 25 years of Kenny Williams, we had exactly one season of excellence with a perfect storm of players that has not once come even close to being the same. I don't want to hear about the strength of schedule in April. With the money we spent, the players we have, playing .500 ball should be underachieving. Not 11 games under .500! We keep going after players that Rick Hahn liked five years ago. Lance Lynn, over the hill. Yas, over the hill. Benintendi, he wanted him in the draft six years ago. He's got a 0.1 WAR. Clevinger isn't just a clubhouse cancer, and a disgusting human being, he's a horrendous pitcher! Joe Kelly has been useless! We signed Vince Velasquez! Give me a break. John Jay, Yonder Alonso. Between [all of] them, that's 200 million on a bunch of black holes and an ERA of 240!\n\n\u200b\n\nThe entire organization is poisoned. The entire way that they go about their business is a failure. Firing Rick isn't enough. Firing Kenny isn't enough. If Chris Getz gets promoted and we have to sit through another 15 year retool/rebuild, you're just going to hear from me again in 2038!\n\n\u200b\n\nI don't care if we go on a torrid winning streak in May and June and somehow get back to .500 ball, and then we scooch our way into the postseason in the Wild Card only to get bounced right away by a team that's actually good. We have no depth in our organization. One injury and we are done. This process isn't working. Our farm system has been in the bottom 10 for 45 years, aside from the one frame of time when they traded all our talent away and graduated them all right up - and then we were the worst again! There is one solution. In his final years, Jerry Reinsdorf, who, by the way, wouldn't even have the reputation he had if he hadn't have lucked upon Michael Jordan at #3 in 1984, has the courage to get rid of the yes men around him and fire everyone. He bought into the Chicago Bulls and the White Sox for $20 million. He's worth two billion now! He needs to use a fraction of that money he made on the backs of Chicago's blue collar baseball fans and pay for a front office to come and rebuild everything.\n\n\u200b\n\nRick Hahn and Kenny Williams cannot be trusted to rebuild this team again. They need to retire and go off into the sunset and play golf with the millions of dollars they made on their cushy paychecks for a job that they had a longer leash for than any executive in the history of the modern era of baseball. Let someone qualified come in and run this team. At this point, we would need a historic turnaround to even be mildly relevant. Everyone said the AL Central was weak, and it might be in comparison to others. But the Sox aren't better than the Guardians or the Twins. We're not even better than the Royals! And the fact that we're only incrementally better than the Tigers is exactly the indictment on this organization that we need. The lack of success that this roster has [had] is a referendum of what we've already seen in 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 16. And the excruciating last seven years that only led to this. I mean, [Steve] Stoney is more worried about Lance Lynn eating a salad than the entire organization not knowing how to teach Major League prospects how to hit a baseball!\n\n\u200b\n\n$200 million [in payroll], we're the laughing stock in the league and everyone needs to be gone. I just need other people in Chicago to be on that - that's the bandwagon we in Chicago need to be on. The entire front office, ownership, they all need to go.", "replies": ["I AIN\u2019T READING ALL OF THAT", "> Vince Velasquez\n\nIF IT MAKES YOU FEEL BETTER, VINCE HAS A 3 ERA AND MORE WAR ALREADY THAN LAST SEASON.

He clearly connects with the players well, keeps guys motivated, and manages his pitching staff expertly.\n\nI have two gripes anyway. First, in 2018-19, he was the best bullpen manager in baseball. He understood that you use your best reliever in the highest leverage situation and that a closer can\u2019t help you if you don\u2019t get to him. He used Hader as a fireman and filled in roles around that.\n\nFast forward a few years, and he is back to the old school rigid bullpen roles. Williams only pitches in the 9th in a save situation. We lost a game last week because Counsell had Matt Bush pitch to the opponent\u2019s 2-3-4 hitters in the 8th, and Williams never got in the game. 2019 Counsell would never have let that happen, but 2023 Counsell does. It is very strange.\n\nSecond, he loves his platoons way too much. No matter how bad a RHH is, Counsell will play them over much better LHH when a LHP is on the mound. So we get Owen Miller starting in LF with Yelich and Winker on the bench. This strategy has made the Brewers consistently terrible against LHP over the last 3-4 seasons, yet Counsell keeps doing it.\n\nI really like him though and have no desire to see a change in manager.

Think about all the promises that Rick Hahn made, mired in mediocrity, that he bragged about Romy Gonz\u00e1lez in Spring Training, and I'll trade him if I get the right price. Think about the things Grifol said, \"Come to the park, we're going to kick everyone's butts.\" They must have been talking about the fans! Not the other teams. The entire lineup is batting under .220. The best hitter on the team is Jake. Burger! We're a Triple A team. Our right fielders are hitting .180 with a weighted runs created plus (wRC+) of 28! I don't even need to tell you about the pitching staff. Katz has got to go. Moncada, TA, Eloy, Yas, Joe Kelly - it's week 4! They've all already been hurt! Tens of millions of dollars on replacement level players while stars go elsewhere. We're 11 games under .500. The Bears needed six months to get 11 games under .500. We needed three weeks.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn the 15 years of Rick Hahn, we have been a constant experiment that has never panned out. In the 25 years of Kenny Williams, we had exactly one season of excellence with a perfect storm of players that has not once come even close to being the same. I don't want to hear about the strength of schedule in April. With the money we spent, the players we have, playing .500 ball should be underachieving. Not 11 games under .500! We keep going after players that Rick Hahn liked five years ago. Lance Lynn, over the hill. Yas, over the hill. Benintendi, he wanted him in the draft six years ago. He's got a 0.1 WAR. Clevinger isn't just a clubhouse cancer, and a disgusting human being, he's a horrendous pitcher! Joe Kelly has been useless! We signed Vince Velasquez! Give me a break. John Jay, Yonder Alonso. Between \\[all of\\] them, that's 200 million on a bunch of black holes and an ERA of 240!\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe entire organization is poisoned. The entire way that they go about their business is a failure. Firing Rick isn't enough. Firing Kenny isn't enough. If Chris Getz gets promoted and we have to sit through another 15 year retool/rebuild, you're just going to hear from me again in 2038!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't care if we go on a torrid winning streak in May and June and somehow get back to .500 ball, and then we scooch our way into the postseason in the Wild Card only to get bounced right away by a team that's actually good. We have no depth in our organization. One injury and we are done. This process isn't working. Our farm system has been in the bottom 10 for 45 years, aside from the one frame of time when they traded all our talent away and graduated them all right up - and then we were the worst again! There is one solution. In his final years, Jerry Reinsdorf, who, by the way, wouldn't even have the reputation he had if he hadn't have lucked upon Michael Jordan at #3 in 1984, has the courage to get rid of the yes men around him and fire everyone. He bought into the Chicago Bulls and the White Sox for $20 million. He's worth two billion now! He needs to use a fraction of that money he made on the backs of Chicago's blue collar baseball fans and pay for a front office to come and rebuild everything.\r\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRick Hahn and Kenny Williams cannot be trusted to rebuild this team again. They need to retire and go off into the sunset and play golf with the millions of dollars they made on their cushy paychecks for a job that they had a longer leash for than any executive in the history of the modern era of baseball. Let someone qualified come in and run this team. At this point, we would need a historic turnaround to even be mildly relevant. Everyone said the AL Central was weak, and it might be in comparison to others. But the Sox aren't better than the Guardians or the Twins. We're not even better than the Royals! And the fact that we're only incrementally better than the Tigers is exactly the indictment on this organization that we need. The lack of success that this roster has \\[had\\] is a referendum of what we've already seen in 2006, 2007, 2011, 2013, 2015 and 16. And the excruciating last seven years that only led to this. I mean, \\[Steve\\] Stoney is more worried about Lance Lynn eating a salad than the entire organization not knowing how to teach Major League prospects how to hit a baseball!\n\n&#x200B;\n\n$200 million \\[in payroll\\], we're the laughing stock in the league and everyone needs to be gone. I just need other people in Chicago to be on that - that's the bandwagon we in Chicago need to be on. The entire front office, ownership, they all need to go.\"", "replies": ["That's gonna be one hell of a pasta.", "Thanks boss haha", "That is epic.

That way, they came closer to getting certain value for their prospects than if they had just let their prospects come up.\n\nBut the other thing about the \"Rebuild\" is that it's clearly not necessary.

They are never in full rebuild, they are always just shuffling pieces around enough to stay revelant. However the downside of that strategy is you're also never fully going for it either, you will be forced to do things like the Hader trade to maximize return. \n\nI guess it just depends on the individual fan and what they would like to watch more. 3-4 seasons of complete tanking followed by (hopefully) 3-4 seasons of being a powerhouse, or being a fringe playoff team every year, never a favorite, but if things go right you make the playoffs and make a run.", "The difference is that the padres then bought major pieces.

Snit knows some games are probably lost and he can\u2019t panic that we\u2019ll lose those ones. \n\nAnd yep, sometimes the hitters aren\u2019t getting enough hits. I blame the Astros losses largely on that. Especially in that first one. If we actually scored after the first inning, maybe we would\u2019ve won that game.

The lineups are made up not just of players but of specific seasons of those players. The first lineup, dubbed the \u201cCadillacs\u201d, consists of player seasons where the player had good to excellent traditional offensive numbers, but a low WAR total. The average WAR of a player in the Cadillacs lineup is 1.1 with a high of 2.7. Their total WAR is 9.1.\n\nThe second lineup, dubbed the \u201cFords\u201d, consists of player seasons where the players had mostly poor to middling (and even some good) traditional offensive numbers but had high WAR totals. The average WAR of a player in the Fords lineup is 4.7 with a low of 3.1. Their total WAR is 37.5.\n\nThe Cadillacs: \nC. Brian McCann \u2013 2007 \u2013 1 WAR\n1B.

What if they played 10 times? What about 100 times? How many games might each team win in a typical season given neutral ballpark conditions and equal pitching? The Ford\u2019s have 4X the amount of WAR that the Cadillacs do. Would they win 4X as many games as the WAR might suggest? Would they be 4X as good as the Cadillacs? That doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. How about 2X? Would they be twice as good as the Cadillacs and win twice the amount of games? Would the teams be even? Might the Cadillacs even win more than the Fords?\n\nJust an exercise and a series of hypothetical questions that are really meant to highlight that WAR is not made to be taken or to be applied literally. This isn\u2019t a dig on WAR itself. WAR is something that I use and reference regularly. It\u2019s an extremely useful metric and its simplicity gives it a great deal of utility in player evaluation.

Being a defensive wizard, Mark Belanger doesn't have to hit well if he's got Boog Powell or Don Baylor playing first. But if Belanger's got Doug Mientkiewicz playing first, that obviously changes things.\n\nIn general, I'll take the team that's tuned more for preventing runs than for scoring runs."}, {"body": "Huge number of problems here:\n\n>I put together two diametrically opposed lineups based off of WAR totals. The lineups are made up not just of players but of specific seasons of those players. The first lineup, dubbed the \u201cCadillacs\u201d, consists of player seasons where the player had good to excellent traditional offensive numbers, but a low WAR total. The average WAR of a player in the Cadillacs lineup is 1.1 with a high of 2.7. Their total WAR is 9.1.\n\nWhat does good to excellent mean? 1993 Jeff Kent had a 105 OPS+. 2015 Dee Strange-Gordon had a 116 OPS+. Baserunning is also considered in offensive WAR, and 2015 Gordon led the majors with 58 steals. Gordon was a MUCH more valuable offensive player even before getting to defense. What was your methodology here?\n\n>The Cadillacs: C. Brian McCann \u2013 2007 \u2013 1 WAR 1B. Paul Konerko \u2013 2002 \u2013 2 WAR 2B. Jeff Kent \u2013 1993 - .3 WAR 3B. Ron Cey \u2013 1983 \u2013 1.8 WAR SS. Miguel Tejada \u2013 2009\u2013 1.9 WAR LF. Dante Bichette \u2013 1999 - (negative)-2.3 WAR CF. Joe Carter \u2013 1990 - 1.7 WAR RF. Juan Gonzalez \u2013 1997 \u2013 2.7 WAR\n\n>The Fords:\n\n>C. Jim Sundberg-1974- 4 WAR 1B. Doug Mientkiewicz \u2013 2003 \u2013 4.3 WAR 2B. Dee Strange-Gordon- 2015 \u2013 4.3 WAR 3B. Lenny Harris \u2013 1990 \u2013 3.1 WAR SS. Mark Belanger -1976 \u2013 6.5 WAR LF. Alex Gordon \u2013 2014 \u2013 6.1 WAR CF. Paul Blair \u2013 1974 \u2013 5.3 WAR RF. Mark Kotsay \u2013 1998 \u2013 3.9 WAR\n\nI don't understand how getting way different players with way different WAR values from way different time periods with different #s of games played works as a criticism. Most of us have no conception of what 1974 Jim Sundberg's defensive abilities looked like. Why aren't you comparing 2009 Adam Dunn (144 OPS+, negative WAR) to 2009 Chase Utley (134 OPS+, 8 WAR)? For a fair criticism, you need to show that two players at the same position in similar years and similar games played have unfair WAR differences based on baserunning/defense. That means you need an understanding of how dWAR is figured out. \n\n>Who would win if these two teams were to face off? What if they played 10 times? What about 100 times? How many games might each team win in a typical season given neutral ballpark conditions and equal pitching? The Ford\u2019s have 4X the amount of WAR that the Cadillacs do. Would they win 4X as many games as the WAR might suggest? Would they be 4X as good as the Cadillacs? That doesn\u2019t seem to make sense. How about 2X? Would they be twice as good as the Cadillacs and win twice the amount of games? Would the teams be even? Might the Cadillacs even win more than the Fords?\n\n4x the amount of WAR doesn't mean 4x as good or win 4/5 games, and I've never seen anyone read WAR like that. WAR says that, if a 40ish win team of next guys off the bench added this player, they'd get x many more wins in a season. Seems like you're setting up a strawman here. \n\n>Just an exercise and a series of hypothetical questions that are really meant to highlight that WAR is not made to be taken or to be applied literally. This isn\u2019t a dig on WAR itself. WAR is something that I use and reference regularly. It\u2019s an extremely useful metric and its simplicity gives it a great deal of utility in player evaluation.

Just some food for thought from my point of view. Thoughts?\n\nYou're saying the system should be looked at for cracks but not specifying what those cracks are. The \"eye test\" is not superior to tens of thousands of hours of statistical analysis. Did you watch Belanger's season in 1976? Do you know how many times he went 0 for 5 but caught a 10% catch probability line drive, preventing a double? Do you know how many times Gonzalez missed that line drive? Gonzalez also DHed most games in 1997. Do you know how the league average DH hit compared to other positions?\n\nYour argument boils down to \"defense and baserunning aren't worth as much as hitting and positional adjustment bad\" with zero actual analysis or numbers to back that up.", "replies": ["Good to excellent means just that, good to excellent.

My armchair analysis/vent:\n\nSeems like a lack of finesse in his framing. But also there\u2019s, like, a weird inconsistency to it? He\u2019ll sometimes do a halfway decent frame job and steal a strike, but just as often it looks half-assed and we don\u2019t get the call. The worst is when he assumes a strike will be called so he doesn\u2019t sell it\u2026and we don\u2019t get the call. I swear this has happened in multiple key moments. \n\nOverall we\u2019re definitely not getting as many calls. I suspect our pitchers are noticing, and getting frustrated, and it\u2019s making them perform worse.  \n\nAlso, have yet to see an impressive block on a tough pitch. If it\u2019s wild, it\u2019s hitting the backstop. This feels weird. \n\nThat said, arm seems pretty good and his game calling seems ok (I\u2019m no expert). Been impressed with his bat despite him starting slow.

His pitch sequencing has been just....I don't even know what to say. Having guys who have had success with their FB last year are throwing so much off speed, and it's getting hit. Often our of the park. Calling for our closer who throws an unhittable 103mph FB to throw four 89ish mph sliders in a row is absurd.\n\nIt was reported last weekend that he had a pitcher's meeting where he suggested that we pitch inside more aggressively, which is at least a better idea than what was clearly not working, and our new (completely fresh to coaching in the majors) pitching coach went along with it without any pushback. The only game we've won since he got ejected in Seattle was...caught by our backup catcher. I want all of this to resolve.

CC Sabathia for Matt LaPorta and Michael Brantley. Don Sutton for Kevin Bass. Christian Yelich for Jordan Yamamoto and some magic beans. But I care too much to keep that narrow of a worldview. Anyone can pull off the steal of the decade. Heck, it's even easier to get pilfered (see: Dinelson Lamet). But I believe the truly most beautiful trade is the zero-sum trade. It might be worth a headline (or not) at the time, but no one remembers it anymore because everyone fell apart. Thus, I've dug through the archives to bring you some of the most mediocre analysis on the internet! Move over, Adam McCalvy! Because here I come, with another weak-hitting, uninspiring, too-niche-for-anyone-to-care article! I'm proud to present some of the least impactful trades in Brewers history!\n\nThree things of note before we get into it. Number one, this is not a ranking list. Remember, there are no winners and losers in these trades. And number two, all graphs are of my own creation. That's right, there's graphs! You know I'm serious now! And finally, number three, all WAR is Baseball Reference WAR. I know it's not the most accurate but who cares about accuracy when you get to deal with players like Ray King!\n\nDecember 10, 2015. The Milwaukee Brewers purchased **Garin Cecchini** from the Boston Red Sox.\n\nThis is a big one. At the time, the Brewers were thin at the corner infield positions, so getting a 24-year-old former top prospect would add some much-needed depth. And Cecchini genuinely would improve his bat that season. In 2015, Cecchini posted a .583 OPS in 117 games at AAA Pawtucket. In 2016, he'd bump it up to .705 in 126 games at AAA Colorado Springs! Talk about a change of scenery!\n\nI think that this [scouting report](https://imgur.com/gallery/QcZXpsd) sums it up nicely. 1st 3rd baseman with speed? Well, if he had speed, he certainly wasn't the first third baseman to have it. I recall Chone Figgins having speed, and Howard Johnson did as well. Maybe he was the 3rd 3rd baseman with speed. \n\nHe never suited up for Milwaukee and was non-tendered after the season. Rating: **Forgettable** \n\nSeptember 4, 2007. The Washington Nationals traded **Ray King** to the Milwaukee Brewers for a player to be named later. The Milwaukee Brewers sent **Andrew Lefave** (September 14, 2007) to the Washington Nationals to complete the trade.\n\nIn Ray King's second stint as a Brewer, he didn't really do much of anything. 12 games pitched, 6.00 ERA. To his credit, though, he did only walk three batters the entire time (although it was only 6 IP). King would pull a Jim Slaton and rejoin the Nationals in free agency, having pitched to a nice crisp 0.0 WAR. But what about the other side of the equation?\n\nYou could make an argument that Andrew Lefave was an underrated piece of the Nationals' bench in the late 2000s. Unfortunately, you would be incorrect in that argument as he never made it above AA, for a nice crisp 0.0 career WAR. He did have a good High A season for the Brewers' affiliate in 2007, though, joining the 59-59 club (59 K, 59 BB) and getting hit 10 times, an average of 10 HBP per season over the course of that year. However, he immediately stopped rayking upon getting traded, and was out of baseball by 2009.\n\n[This graph](https://imgur.com/gallery/7Hv9JTz) shows the effect that the trade had on the win-loss record of each team. The differences are based on WAR and have been calculated to the best of my ability. Rating: **Who cares**\n\nMay 2, 2021. The Milwaukee Brewers purchased **Jacob Nottingham** from the Seattle Mariners.\n\nI don't even need to explain this one. You all remember what happened. Instead, let's have a look at [this graph](https://imgur.com/gallery/zQODFfF).\n\nOh dear.\n\nWell, this is still hypothetical. [Let's pull up the stats.](https://imgur.com/gallery/1CV5E69)\n\nOh dear.\n\nThe numbers don't lie. It appears that the Jacob Nottingham trade was the best trade in Brewers history.\n\nToo bad they DFA'd him 18 days later.\n\n**Conclusion**: Sometimes, our actions have consequences. For general managers, it could be a big trade, won or lost by the flashy star acquired or the stud prospect shipped out. Far more often, however, our actions don't have consequences. After all, for every Josh Hader picked up at the deadline, there are a hundred Lewis Brinsons and Luis Ortizes. So why don't we all live our lives that way? After all, it's unlikely anyone will remember your actions in five years. (As an example, name a single player we acquired for Keon Broxton in 2019. You can't.) So skip work to watch baseball. Take that vacation you've been wanting to take. Brake check a semi. Who cares? Nothing is relevant. Nothing matters.\n\nJust make sure to never DFA Jacob Nottingham.", "spoiler": false, "title": "Three of the Least Important Trades in Brewers History", "upvote_ratio": 0.7, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/baseball/comments/1317x72/three_of_the_least_important_trades_in_brewers/", "comments": [{"body": "Ray King is a wasted name on a pitcher."}, {"body": "Man it's April.

For anyone else on my team it was an easy triple maybe ITP HR, for me it was barely a stand up double. \n\nHowever, if there any circumstance where I was on first with second base open and our team up by 10+ runs I would be given a steal sign even though we were bases to bases. This scenario came up pretty often because there were two or three teams in our district circuit that only had 9 players that never practiced. The truest playing for fun teams. I would ignore it most of the time because I don't want to get thrown out, even in a mercy rule game it was embarrassing. \n\nEventually my coach pulled me aside towards the end of the season and told me I can't ignore steal signs any more. I hadn't gotten a steal sign in our last couple games vs. private school teams even though one in one of them I was on first and they were pretty much giving me second for free. The last two games of the season were a double header vs the worst team in our league. They were 0-18, and had technically forfeited all their games because they didn't have 9 players to start any of their games. \n\nIt was the bottom of the 4th in game one, after an inside the park home run pushed the lead to 20+ to 0 with no outs. Their pitcher was just hucking it to the back stop he was so tired. First my best friend walked on 4 balls, immediately he was given a steal sign and was thrown out because even a ball hucked to the backstop got back to the catcher quickly. Then I walked on four pitches, after arriving at the base I immediately saw that I was given a steal sign. I told my first base coach I thought we were bases to bases, then he let it slip \"well not for you guys\". Referring to me and my two friends who were the worst players on the team, hitting in the 7,8,9 spots. \n\nIt was at this moment it clicked for me. We were sacrifices to end the games our team were winning. We were the slowest, and except for one, pretty mediocre hitters. The other guys on my team had pretty fragile egos, like commit 4 errors in an inning because they took a called three strike two years ago kind of fragile. The mercy rule couldn't happen until after 5 innings were completed, if we ended before that then the wins didn't count towards our record for state. So my coach was having us steal to end games faster.\n\nThe most fucked part is my coach eventually admitted that was his strategy after the season ended. He was afraid we would hit the daylight limit since games had to time max and could only be called early due to sundown. He was afraid the innings would go on so long that they would be called before 5 innings and we would lose a win on our record towards state playoffs. He didn't want to throw off the game of our star players so he chose us three.\n\nThat was my last season of rec baseball.

And then played out most of his career not even being a shortstop, and also with [the fucking Yankees](https://imgflip.com/i/7jsrfl).\n\n[Rick Rizzs' call of Luis Sojo clearing the bases in game 163](https://youtu.be/qMzJsmTkkB4?t=2483).\n\nRick himself, Dave's partner from 1983 until Dave's death (except for a few years in the early 90's), the current voice of the Mariners, and an all-time great in his own right.\n\nRandy Johnson going the distance and striking out Tim Salmon to finish game 163, and Dave's call (just keep on watching the video I linked for the Sojo hit until the 43 minute mark for it).\n\nAnd, because I distinctly remember watching this game on summer break between 3rd and 4th grade, [John Valentin turning an unassisted triple play against us](https://www.mlb.com/video/valentin-turns-triple-play-c26377429) (also Dave on the call - man, I love hearing his voice)."]}, {"body": "It's actually the same entity.\n\nSee, Poseidon set up a DBA to be allowed to work in Rome."}, {"body": "As the proud owner of a \u201847 Braves hat; I support this amount petty."}, {"body": "The big hat is made by a company called Noggin Boss.
