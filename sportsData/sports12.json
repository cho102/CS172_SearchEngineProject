Fleeing or attempting to elude may be the felony used to charge felony murder in this analogous case. It could also be an instance where the prosecutor is overcharging.\n\nI\u2019ve spent too much time thinking about this and should eat dinner\u2026so\u2026\n\nTl; dr: maybe? There is a recent analogous instance where someone was charged with felony murder stemming from a race where the opponent racer died.

One of the biggest culprits is that it's the worst sport for action-per-minute in an era of low attention spans and a high number of entertainment options. Game times have been going up year after year, and getting rid of these way-too-long standoffs of zero action between pitcher and batter will help alleviate that. The minor leagues that implemented these timers saw a 25 minute reduction in game time. That's 25 whole fucking minutes of waiting about while hitter and pitcher stroll around before actually getting ready.\n\nEdit to add a conclusion: Bad take from Passan here. This is not the new reality. This is an unfortunate worst-case scenario while players are still adjusting to the new system. We'll see a lot of fuckups in pre-season, and then fewer and fewer as the season goes on and players get used to it.

A batter may delay getting into the batter's box by adjusting gloves, shoes, or clothing or taking excessive warm up swings.  A pitcher may repeatedly attempt to throw out a runner on base even though this has a low likelihood of success.  This may be to aggravate or frustrate their opponent.  \n\nWhile this may be a valid strategy to gain advantage by players, it  also can cause games to take a long time to finish.   This is frustrating to the paying audience and in the long term may reduce its popularity and harm the sport as a whole.\n\nTo combat this the league instituted new rules including time limits for batters to be in position to bat, and pitchers to pitch lest they be penalized.

Three outs and that team's offensive turn is over.\n\nThe endgame situation described (bottom of ninth inning, tie game, bases loaded, two outs, two strikes) is possibly one of the most tense, crucial, suspenseful, and exciting situations you are likely to find in a baseball game.  The batter could successfully hit the ball and drive in a (run)score, and win the game.  Or the pitcher could strike out the batter and in this example extend the game allowing his team another offensive turn and possibly win.\n\nOr like in this example game, the batter can dawdle and be unceremoniously penalized and lose the opportunity to win the game like a moron.

Does a game tying run in the 3rd count? Why wouldn\u2019t it compared to the 6th? Why does that guy need more than 8 seconds for that single particular at bat after each pitch? Why does it matter to have more than 8 seconds when it\u2019s 3-2 than 2-2? Why does he need it more than the guy who got on base in order to give him that opportunity?

He does a shortened version of it when he\u2019s receiving the serve, but when there\u2019s a quick server, like Medvedev, Rafa has to adjust to play at Med\u2019s rhythm.

If anything, it disrupted the natural rhythm of my plate appearance. Anyway, there is no, nor has there ever been any proof it works. Sort of like icing the kicker in football. It just turned into a tradition and soon a unbreakable superstition. These players who step out of the batters box every time and adjust their gloves or kick dirt are doing that because of one simple concept: BAD HABITS. The pitcher disruption strategy has caused players to develop delay tactics which have turned into bad habits, plain and simple. I have gotten so f'ing annoyed by watching batters taking too long outside the box, I start yelling at the television. This culture in baseball needs to change. It's perfectly doable, and has been done before. In the 1970's, the average length of an MLB game was about 2.5 hours. When watching a classic game on television, you can almost be duped into thinking the network deliberately sped up the video! But no, the players actually went at a much quicker pace. There were no 20 second batter pauses between pitches. You took a pitch, took MAYBE 5 seconds and got back in the box. Many times batters even kept one foot in the box. These days, if a batter takes a low, inside pitch and has to abruptly scoot their feet backward to the point all their weight is falling forward, they not only go with the momentum, but take 10 running steps to recover. That's so unnecessary and stupid, it's the baseball equivalent of a flop. Just take a step or two and get back in there. Stop with all the f'ing canned drama. Yes, this is a serious soapbox of mine. Some of my own teammates annoyed TF out of me but I never said a word. This pitch clock had to implemented to get superstition and bad habits under control.

Three outs and that team's offensive turn is over.\n\nThe endgame situation described (bottom of ninth inning, tie game, bases loaded, two outs, two strikes) is possibly one of the most tense, crucial, suspenseful, and exciting situations you are likely to find in a baseball game.  The batter could successfully hit the ball and drive in a (run)score, and win the game.  Or the pitcher could strike out the batter and in this example extend the game allowing his team another offensive turn and possibly win.\n\nOr like in this example game, the batter can dawdle and be unceremoniously penalized and lose the opportunity to win the game like a moron.  The inning ends not with a bang, but with a whimper in the sports equivalent of blue balls.\n\nThe league is working out the kinks in the new rules, you see...", "replies": ["Thanks for the explanation.

Then you have a situation where it's up to interpretation as to what's taken place. Whereas \"you have 8 seconds or it's a strike\" is clear and concise.

Does a game tying run in the 3rd count? Why wouldn\u2019t it compared to the 6th? Why does that guy need more than 8 seconds for that single particular at bat after each pitch? Why does it matter to have more than 8 seconds when it\u2019s 3-2 than 2-2? Why does he need it more than the guy who got on base in order to give him that opportunity? In the ninth the guy setting the table is just as important as well, so why shouldn\u2019t he? It becomes very messy to build an exception to this kind of rule with a consistent set of logic.\n\nThe more this happens in the short term, the less it will happen in the long term.

There are some very dominant pitchers out there and putting a ball in play is statistically highly challenging - I\u2019d rather allow a batter the time to get mentally ready before facing another 100+ mph fastball with movement and have there be a chance they put it in play rather than feel rushed back into the box and whiff for a strike out."}, {"body": "I\u2019m less knowledgeable about hockey but knew there was some sort of rule motivating actively advancing the puck - this delay of game rule would have been a *better* comparison for Jimbo to have made, but it\u2019s still more like basketball\u2019s shot clock than the pitch clock.\n\nThe major difference is that hockey and basketball have a time-based definition of a full game so their \u201cpace of play\u201d rules make sure that there\u2019s a satisfactory amount of real action fitting into that fixed amount of game clock and are *necessary* to prevent the game breaking down into a boring game of \u201ckeep-away\u201d in the backfield once one team has a lead.\n\nSince a baseball game will run for 9 innings / 27 outs per side regardless of run time, neither team really inherently benefits by causing delays between pitches - the delay *won\u2019t* eat into either teams remaining opportunities to contest for the win. (Umps should be empowered with some sort of remedy for extreme cases where a player\u2019s repeated/excessive delays appear to be an attempt to troll/harass their opponent, but a random pitch that happens to take 20 seconds to come out doesn\u2019t especially advantage a particular side). There might be some value to speeding up the time between pitches, but it\u2019s not necessary for gameplay reasons (different from delay of game in hockey/football & shot clock in basketball, where these *do* help avoid meta gaming \u201cabuses\u201d) to the point where it makes sense to over-engineer the rules and risk notably altering the feel of the game."}, {"body": "That\u2019s definitely a good point.

Caswell\u2019s wife and most frequent travel companion, Jaclyn Meyer, lobbied to finish the journey in Hawaii, but when the Rainbow Warriors played a nonconference game at Illinois in November 2019 \u2014 the program\u2019s farthest trip east in more than a decade \u2014 Caswell, who lives outside Dayton, Ohio, decided the opportunity to cross another team off his list without getting on a plane was too good to pass up.\r  \n\r  \nHawaii, which lost to the Fighting Illini that night, was the 330th Division I team Caswell saw play. Three years and 34 teams later, Caswell completed his quest Saturday at Bender Arena, where he watched American lose to visiting Lehigh with Meyer, his mother and his brother by his side.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cThis feels more like a milestone than a conclusion,\u201d Caswell wrote in an email Sunday. \u201cI\u2019ll still go to more basketball games this season and beyond, only now with a fresh air of confidence with this achievement under my belt.\u201d\r  \n\r  \nCaswell\u2019s college basketball odyssey spanned 21 years and took him to 442 games in 131 venues. The first Division I college basketball game he attended was Dayton\u2019s 83-59 rout of George Washington on Jan. 9, 2002, at UD Arena. It was his second game, as a wide-eyed freshman at Bowling Green nearly seven years later, that lit the spark for his impressive and unusual quest.\r  \n\r  \nA Detroit Pistons fan who didn\u2019t pay much attention to college hoops growing up, Caswell, 32, walked into Bowling Green\u2019s Anderson Arena for the first time in the fall of 2008 and grabbed a seat in the front row for a game against Wayne State. He felt a bit like Spike Lee sitting courtside at Madison Square Garden, and he was hooked. Caswell went to most of the Falcons\u2019 home games that season and again as a sophomore, when he made trips to see games at Wright State, Akron and Kent State.\r  \n\r  \nThe quest entered Caswell\u2019s mind during his junior year.\r  \n\r  \n\u201cI thought: \u2018I love to travel, and I love college basketball. How feasible would it be to see every team in Division I?\u2019\u2009\u201d he said. \u201cI was determined to basically consume as much college basketball as I could going forward. All the years since have involved a lot of deliberate planning to try to achieve that goal.\u201d\r  \n\r  \n**Read more about Caswell's cross-country journey here, and skip the paywall with email registration:** [**https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/02/21/college-basketball-fan-sees-every-team/?utm\\_campaign=wp\\_main&utm\\_medium=social&utm\\_source=reddit.com**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2023/02/21/college-basketball-fan-sees-every-team/?utm_campaign=wp_main&utm_medium=social&utm_source=reddit.com)"}, {"body": "Cool"}, {"body": "Now do Division 2."}, {"body": "I spent many hours in Anderson Arena.

Average aint elite pay.([source](https://www.rotowire.com/football/player/hunter-renfrow-13749))  He is the 22nd highest paid wr while having average stats and wasn't on the field for almost half the season. Barely above him at 20th is mike evans who averages $1k yards every season in his career.

That corruption and money fueled contract killings, but not a police state targeting the extended families of critics. Do you know the fates of the relatives of any major critics?

People might read it and believe it, when it very incorrect and based on information that is 30 years old, about a country that has massively changed, multiple times, after you left, and even in the past year. What is more, what you claim now isn\u2019t even correct about the time when you were there. \n\nDid you know that \u201cthe 90s\u201d is a very specific period of Russian history with its own set of conditions? That it is a special period sometimes called the mob wars? Not the great purge? (Purge was 1937).\n\nDid you know that Putin was able to build his own power on the back of at least some governance (not good, but better than Yeltsin) and years of significantly higher oil and gas prices - to say that Russia was no longer the 1990s? So much so that the change is a huge way he keeps power now?\n\nPeople fear another change could bring back the 1990s. This is such an issue it\u2019s even part of why Putin went after Ukraine - if they can have a revolution and not fall into 90s-style chaos, that could encourage Russians that they have a hope of something better too. \n\nDo you know how much Russia has changed since the 1990s? And then changed again after the 2008 crash? And the castling? And in reaction to Maidan and even Bolotnaya? Do you know what those things are? I was at Bolotnaya btw. That was close to 20 years after your last experience. \n\nDid you know that the 1990s were very bad for many reasons, but not as you say Russia is now regarding the extended families of critics? That media and political criticism was far freer? That the controls even of media began in the 2000s, after you left? That corruption and money fueled contract killings, but not a police state targeting the extended families of critics. Do you know the fates of the relatives of any major critics? Or how anything worked back then? \n\nDid you know that Russia and Central Asia are separate countries with their own individual trajectories, including in the 1990s? That even Russia is diverse? Ovechkin\u2019s family is in Moscow, not Chechnya, and that makes a hell of a difference. \n\nDo you know who Navalny is? Do you know where his wife is right now? What about the families of the people who did the the truly dangerous exposing corruption and paid the most for it people like - Mikhail Lesin or Ivan Safronov or Anna Politkovsjaya? Or the family of people like Ilya Yashin, a longtime opposition activist who is himself in jail for explicitly opposing the war? \n\nThe only family member of theirs in true danger is the extremely admirable son of Safranov. Why?  Because he also became an investigative reporter and himself discovered massive corruption. Not because of his relative\u2019s actions. \n\nAnd even that Safronov\u2019s family hasn\u2019t been targeted in Russia, right now - when things are far worse for critics than the 1990s - the way you say the family of a famous, rich, connected Russian would be if he only stepped back from being exploit propaganda himself.\n\nAnd finally, do you know that no one is asking Ovechkin to return to Russia and personally oppose Putin, just to stop being such an deliberate propaganda tool for mass murder and war crimes in Ukraine, and hurting so many Russians and Russia itself in the process? \n\nDid you miss all that or just forget?

The will of the Ukrainian people to live as a sovereign people is a thorn at Russia's side and must be eliminated. \n\nMoving your army into their country with this goal is considered an act of genocide. \n\nTo a pro-Putin Russian, the war is caused by Ukraine resisting, not by Russia's aggression.\n\n\"No more war\" happens when Ukraine lays down their arms and accepts their defeat.\n\n\"We want peace\" means give us your country so we don't have to fight anymore.\n\nTherefore those words from Ovechkin are less than nothing.

He says he doesn't support war!\", you don't really get the situation. \n\nI think you should do some research that goes beyond only North American perspectives if you truly wish to understand the situation, then go back to this Ovechkin situation and see if you feel differently.

He pleaded no contest and received a suspended sentence.\n\nIn 1990 he was suspended for a game and charged with interfering with a firefighter, providing false information, and harassment. Most of those charges were dropped. \n\nHe was arrested again for failing to appear after being charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended license. \n\nIn 1993, Bieniemy was arrested again in Boulder after grabbing a female parking attendant by the throat and threatening her. This incident caused him to be banned from the University of Colorado\u2019s campus. He was a coach there a decade later. \n\nBy 2001, his license had been suspended a second time after a DUI conviction and multiple moving violations.\n\nIn 2004, he and other Colorado coaches were accused of using drugs and alcohol to entice high school recruits. The resulting scandal revealed at least four accusations of sexual assault by players. One of the victims was Colorado\u2019s kicker, Katie Hnida. A Colorado staffer also hired prostitutes for recruits. Bieniemy was accused of helping to cover up the allegations. Bieniemy, and the rest of the staff, were fired for their roles in the scandal. \n\nIt\u2019s just too much baggage for a person who\u2019s never been a head coach before. \n\nBut the issue is not just his legal past. Vance Joseph was part of that same Colorado coaching staff and became a head coach. Matt Patricia has a very credible sexual assault allegation against him.

He pleaded no contest and received a suspended sentence.\n\nIn 1990 he was suspended for a game and charged with interfering with a firefighter, providing false information, and harassment. Most of those charges were dropped. \n\nHe was arrested again for failing to appear after being charged with leaving the scene of an accident and driving with a suspended license. \n\nIn 1993, Bieniemy was arrested again in Boulder after grabbing a female parking attendant by the throat and threatening her. This incident caused him to be banned from the University of Colorado\u2019s campus. He was a coach there a decade later. \n\nBy 2001, his license had been suspended a second time after a DUI conviction and multiple moving violations.\n\nIn 2004, he and other Colorado coaches were accused of using drugs and alcohol to entice high school recruits. The resulting scandal revealed at least four accusations of sexual assault by players. One of the victims was Colorado\u2019s kicker, Katie Hnida. A Colorado staffer also hired prostitutes for recruits. Bieniemy was accused of helping to cover up the allegations. Bieniemy, and the rest of the staff, were fired for their roles in the scandal. \n\nIt\u2019s just too much baggage for a person who\u2019s never been a head coach before. \n\nBut the issue is not just his legal past. Vance Joseph was part of that same Colorado coaching staff and became a head coach. Matt Patricia has a very credible sexual assault allegation against him.
