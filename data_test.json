  "selftext": "I believe that kickers are pretty undervalued, however, I am not sure how I see much of a point in drafting kickers high if you can have an offense that scores basically time they have the ball. You need to add playmakers to your team; particularly explosive playmakers. I believe an all pro return specialist should always be valued higher than a great kicker. Particularly teams looking to compete in the playoffs. \n\nIs this a bad take? I guess I\u2019m not really sure where other people stand on this. And when I am talking all pro return players, I\u2019m thinking in the likes of Patterson, Deion, Edelman, Hester, etc. Also that player designation tends to add value at other positions (versatility). \n\n\nCurious to know what others may think about this argument.",
