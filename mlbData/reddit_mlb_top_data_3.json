He's not worthy of honor because was not honorable.\n\nNo one is ever gonna think about rehabbing John Rocker. All he did was say this\n\n> I'd retire first. [New York] is the most hectic, nerve-wracking city. Imagine having to take the 7 Train to the ballpark looking like you're riding through Beirut next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids.

His tone is only slightly off color for the time; nowadays one doesn't say 'queer' as if this is a self-evidently bad thing to be.

Murphy rigged an underground wire from his perch to the third-base coaching box, where Bull Childs kept his foot above a junction box that would signal the pitch by buzzing once or twice. The Reds discovered and uprooted the system after they noticed Childs was not moving his right foot\u2014not even when that portion of the coaching box included a puddle from rain. The Phillies \u201cexplained\u201d the wire as something left behind by a traveling circus that had played at the ballpark. The club was not disciplined.\n\nMurphy also used a system in which he signaled the pitches to hitters with curtains attached to his perch\u2019s awning. Murphy used a similar system on the road by using handkerchiefs or a rolled-up newspaper from rooftops, buildings or bleachers. On Sept. 26, 1900, the Brooklyn Superbas caught him signaling from the top floor of a flathouse beyond the centerfield fence at Washington Park in Brooklyn.\n\nMurphy\u2019s entire existence on the roster seemed due to his sign-stealing talents. From 1899-1901 he played in only 20 games. When the Phillies sent him to the minors in 1901, newspapers referred to him as \u201cchief of the buzzer department.\u201d\n\n1909 Highlanders\n\nGene McCann, a former player, was stationed behind the centerfield fence and peered through a hole with binoculars. He would tip off the scoreboard operator, who would tip vertical the horizontal bar in the \u201cH\u201d in Highlanders for a fastball. One day in September a trainer from the Tigers surprised McCann during a game, overpowering him and seizing the binoculars.\n\n1910-14 Athletics\n\nSubstitute outfielder Danny Murphy, armed with binoculars, stood next to a weathervane on a rooftop in Philadelphia. He spun the weathervane north for a curveball and south for a fastball. The system worked well, except for when a gust of wind spun the weathervane in another direction.\n\n1948 Indians\n\nBraves pitcher Johnny Sain charged the Indians with putting a spy in the scoreboard with binoculars. The man would ring a buzzer in the dugout to signal the pitch. Later reports said Cleveland pitchers Bob Feller and Bob Lemon used a telescope obtained from a World War II navy ship. They called out pitches to a groundskeeper, who signaled hitters through an opening in the scoreboard or from a seated position in the bleachers.\n\n1948 Cubs\n\nGene Mauch and Peanuts Lowry of the Cubs watched a game against the Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York with binoculars from the centerfield clubhouse. When they saw a sign for a fastball they put a bright peach nectar can in the window. For a curve, they took it down.\n\n1951 Giants\n\nThe team stole signs from its centerfield clubhouse at the Polo Grounds with the use of a sophisticated 35-millimeter Wollensak telescope. An electrician rigged the phones between the clubhouse and bullpen, which was located in fair territory in right-centerfield 440 feet from home plate. One buzz meant fastball; two buzzes meant an off-speed pitch. Third-base coach Herman Franks, a former catcher, moved to the bullpen to decode the signs (which is why manager Leo Durocher came to coach third base in the second half of the season). Sal Yvars, a backup catcher stationed in the bullpen, would hold a baseball to signal fastball.

It was the eighth NBC telecast using the newly installed centerfield camera. Because of the controversy, and at the request of commissioner Ford Frick, NBC said it would discontinue use of the centerfield camera.\n\n1959 Giants\n\nThe Giants used a spy in the scoreboard to steal signs. Giants pitcher Al Worthington, a deeply religious man, told manager Bill Rigney he could not abide such cheating and asked for a trade. The Giants traded him to the White Sox.\n\n1960 White Sox\n\nWorthington quit his next team because that team was cheating, too. He quit in August because the White Sox stole signs from the centerfield scoreboard at Comiskey Park.\n\nPitcher Bob Shaw, after being traded by the White Sox to the Athletics in 1961, described the scheme: \"They used a tube with a light in it, and somebody would sit in the scoreboard \u2026 If the light went on it was a fastball, if it didn\u2019t it was a curve.\"\n\n1960 Braves\n\nTwo Braves starting pitchers, Joey Jay and Bob Buhl, were discovered sitting in the bleachers at Wrigley Field and waving white scorecards to hitters to tell them what pitch was coming.\n\n1961 Reds\n\nAccording to Cincinnati pitcher Jay Hook, his team put a scout, a former pitcher named Brooks Lawrence, in the centerfield scoreboard at Crosley Field to steal signs and relay them to the dugout via telephone. Hook made his comments after joining the Mets in 1962.\n\nPresaging Fiers, Hook said then, \u201cI didn\u2019t say anything about it, but now I\u2019m on the Mets and I want to protect the Mets against that sort of thing.

He told reporters the White Sox \u201care not going to play in the Cleveland ballpark again until either the commissioner or American League president takes a look at that scoreboard.\u201d\n\n1973 Brewers\n\nRangers manager Whitey Herzog accused Bernie Brewer, the Milwaukee Brewers mascot, of partaking in a sign stealing scheme from his chalet in the outfield. According to Herzog, a man next to Bernie Brewer stole signs with binoculars. Bernie Brewer, dressed in Bavarian garb, would signal a breaking pitch to the batter by clapping furiously with his white gloves. He took off the gloves when the Rangers batted. Herzog complained to umpire Tom Haller, who chased away the man with binoculars and told Bernie Brewer to keep his gloves off.\n\n1976 Athletics\n\nHerzog, then manager of the Royals, complained the A\u2019s were stealing signs from their bullpen with the help of binoculars.

The claim led to a rule against such surveillance.\n\n1997 Mets\n\nThe Philadelphia Phillies complained to the league office that the Mets were using video cameras trained on opposing third-base coaches, pitchers and dugouts to steal signs. The league told the Mets to be sure the cameras were trained only on batters and pitchers.\n\n1999 Indians\n\nRed Sox manager Jimy Williams presented evidence to umpire Tim Welke that the Indians used a camera atop the centerfield wall to steal signs. Welke ordered the Indians to cover the camera. (The Red Sox claimed the signs were transmitted to the hitter by whistling from the dugout.) Cleveland said the camera was used to evaluate player performance.\n\n2010 Phillies\n\nThe Rockies accused the Phillies of stealing signs after Philadelphia bullpen coach Mick Billmeyer was shown on camera using binoculars when the Rockies were batting. The Phillies denied the binoculars were used to steal signs."]}, {"body": "So you want to investigate all teams even though none broke any explicit rules or memos?\n\nHere are all the allegations for you dating back to the 1900s.\n\n\n1899-1900 Phillies\n\nA backup catcher named Morgan Murphy watched games at Baker Bowl in an \u201cobservatory\u201d beyond the centerfield wall, where he stole signs with binoculars. Murphy rigged an underground wire from his perch to the third-base coaching box, where Bull Childs kept his foot above a junction box that would signal the pitch by buzzing once or twice. The Reds discovered and uprooted the system after they noticed Childs was not moving his right foot\u2014not even when that portion of the coaching box included a puddle from rain. The Phillies \u201cexplained\u201d the wire as something left behind by a traveling circus that had played at the ballpark. The club was not disciplined.\n\nMurphy also used a system in which he signaled the pitches to hitters with curtains attached to his perch\u2019s awning. Murphy used a similar system on the road by using handkerchiefs or a rolled-up newspaper from rooftops, buildings or bleachers. On Sept. 26, 1900, the Brooklyn Superbas caught him signaling from the top floor of a flathouse beyond the centerfield fence at Washington Park in Brooklyn.\n\nMurphy\u2019s entire existence on the roster seemed due to his sign-stealing talents. From 1899-1901 he played in only 20 games. When the Phillies sent him to the minors in 1901, newspapers referred to him as \u201cchief of the buzzer department.\u201d\n\n1909 Highlanders\n\nGene McCann, a former player, was stationed behind the centerfield fence and peered through a hole with binoculars. He would tip off the scoreboard operator, who would tip vertical the horizontal bar in the \u201cH\u201d in Highlanders for a fastball. One day in September a trainer from the Tigers surprised McCann during a game, overpowering him and seizing the binoculars.\n\n1910-14 Athletics\n\nSubstitute outfielder Danny Murphy, armed with binoculars, stood next to a weathervane on a rooftop in Philadelphia. He spun the weathervane north for a curveball and south for a fastball. The system worked well, except for when a gust of wind spun the weathervane in another direction.\n\n1948 Indians\n\nBraves pitcher Johnny Sain charged the Indians with putting a spy in the scoreboard with binoculars. The man would ring a buzzer in the dugout to signal the pitch. Later reports said Cleveland pitchers Bob Feller and Bob Lemon used a telescope obtained from a World War II navy ship. They called out pitches to a groundskeeper, who signaled hitters through an opening in the scoreboard or from a seated position in the bleachers.\n\n1948 Cubs\n\nGene Mauch and Peanuts Lowry of the Cubs watched a game against the Giants at the Polo Grounds in New York with binoculars from the centerfield clubhouse. When they saw a sign for a fastball they put a bright peach nectar can in the window. For a curve, they took it down.\n\n1951 Giants\n\nThe team stole signs from its centerfield clubhouse at the Polo Grounds with the use of a sophisticated 35-millimeter Wollensak telescope. An electrician rigged the phones between the clubhouse and bullpen, which was located in fair territory in right-centerfield 440 feet from home plate. One buzz meant fastball; two buzzes meant an off-speed pitch. Third-base coach Herman Franks, a former catcher, moved to the bullpen to decode the signs (which is why manager Leo Durocher came to coach third base in the second half of the season). Sal Yvars, a backup catcher stationed in the bullpen, would hold a baseball to signal fastball. To indicate an off-speed pitch he would toss the ball in the air.\n\nWord about the system first surfaced in a report from an anonymous player in 1962.\n\n1954-56 White Sox\n\nManager Marty Marion said he put a coach, Del Wilber, in the centerfield scoreboard with binoculars.

The trick is to figure out the few that weren't doing them. The idea that those could also be a favorite players is a little bit convenient. But like I said, I don't care if my favorite player did steroids like every other player did. It wasn't cheating until Major League baseball was called upon by Congress to show why it was allowing the rampant use of steroids. After that Major League baseball started a PR campaign to show that there were a few cheaters ruining the game. The fact is that Bud Selig became commissioner because he and a few other owners were afraid that Faye Vincent was going to push steroids out of the game in 1991. They understood the value of more home runs for viewership. They got it. Then they spun it so that you and other fans would believe that it was cheating and it was immoral and it was no longer allowed. \n\nFor me it doesn't take anything away from what Griffey did. He was a great player who had a long history of injuries that stopped him from being among the greatest ever. However, normal humans couldn't recover from those injuries as quickly as he did and still play the level that he did. It never happened before in baseball. Steroids helps that. And I've always believed that that's how steroids should be used in baseball. Major League baseball had an opportunity to allow the limited use of steroids for off-season training and in season healing.

He played in MLB at the height of the steroid era when it is commonly believed and confirmed by many players that everyone did steroids.  Faye Vincent nearly said as much in 1991 when he began the effort of getting steroids out of the game.  They were common then.  No players thought of any silly moral implications. They were exercise enhancing drugs that made you perform better, stronger and richer.  \n\nBTW, it is not cheating.

Steroids have been in baseball since the '60s at least. Most players off the record have admitted that All of their teammates were doing them. The trick is to figure out the few that weren't doing them. The idea that those could also be a favorite players is a little bit convenient. But like I said, I don't care if my favorite player did steroids like every other player did. It wasn't cheating until Major League baseball was called upon by Congress to show why it was allowing the rampant use of steroids. After that Major League baseball started a PR campaign to show that there were a few cheaters ruining the game. The fact is that Bud Selig became commissioner because he and a few other owners were afraid that Faye Vincent was going to push steroids out of the game in 1991. They understood the value of more home runs for viewership. They got it. Then they spun it so that you and other fans would believe that it was cheating and it was immoral and it was no longer allowed. \n\nFor me it doesn't take anything away from what Griffey did. He was a great player who had a long history of injuries that stopped him from being among the greatest ever. However, normal humans couldn't recover from those injuries as quickly as he did and still play the level that he did. It never happened before in baseball. Steroids helps that. And I've always believed that that's how steroids should be used in baseball. Major League baseball had an opportunity to allow the limited use of steroids for off-season training and in season healing. They could have included a proviso that said player must be one month clean of steroids before returning to the game. Something to that effect. Because they were all using them anyway. So why keep hiding from it and pretending that it's a dirty, dirty crime?."}, {"body": "The injuries are an argument AGAINST steroid use. The whole point of steroids is healing your body. They don\u2019t just make you jacked, they just allow you to work out more. They\u2019re mostly used to treat injuries.

And neither can you. I have been staring at 2-time caught steroid user Nelfi Perez and trying to see it. I've been looking at Andy Petite.  You cannot tell who is doing steroids by looking at them. Maybe there was a point when Bonds started using more steroids, different steroids, or another drug and is body changed. But you cannot tell when he wasn't or was.\n\n>Griffey...has just never been connected to steroids in anyway\n\nYes he has. He played in MLB at the height of the steroid era when it is commonly believed and confirmed by many players that everyone did steroids.  Faye Vincent nearly said as much in 1991 when he began the effort of getting steroids out of the game.  They were common then.  No players thought of any silly moral implications. They were exercise enhancing drugs that made you perform better, stronger and richer.  \n\nBTW, it is not cheating. If you think of it like vitamins, or weight-lifting or other advantage-getting behavior it won't be so hard for you to understand how ridiculous it is to image a player taking them in an era when everyone took them and made a lot more money taking them."}, {"body": "> They are literally used for recovery from injury.\n\nRight. They are. But they are not miracle drugs. They do not cause healing. They help with healing. \n\nYou could argue (and I am) that Griffey did recover from his injuries more quickly due to steroids.  He kept coming back from significant injuries.  Should I use that as proof he did it? It's more valid than using that he was injured as proof that he didn't use steroids. \n\nDo you expect him to be completely healed as proof that he used steroids?\n\nI questioned the poster's understand of the efficacy of steroids regarding healing because they said he would have recovered faster. Faster than what? There is absolutely no baseline for comparison to make this point valid.  \n\nGriffey was injured a lot and recovered and kept playing at a very high level. That is more of a reason to suspect that he, like every other player in the league, used steroids at the very least to get back on the field more quickly."}, {"body": ">Back in the WWII era everyone smoked, dipped and drank during their games.\n\nDo you really think this is true? How is this different in your eyes from me saying that everyone did steroids in the 90s? Ruth played 20 years. Cobb played more. We could trade outlier anecdotes all day. It's irrelevant to the topic at hand.  The point was that was the last \"clean\" era. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>In the 60s, tearing an ACL was a death sentence to your career. Now we have players coming back the very next season exactly like they were because we have a much greater understanding of how to properly rehab injuries.\n\nIn general they do not come back the same. I understand your point, of course, sports medicine has improved. But steroids are what help most with the recovery of serious injuries. There is no testing on the DL.\n\n>A defining characteristic of a player like Bonds suddenly taking steroids is an insane late career resurgence like he had.\n\nWait. Aren't you the one who said \"Not everything is steroids?\"\n\nDo you understand that \"resurgence\" implies that he had a down period? Bonds had a 14 year run of getting MVP votes. 14 fucking years! There was no resurgence. He got better and better and better. He did have a down year in 2005 at 40 years old! But then he had a resurgence his final two years and put up sick numbers again before he was black-balled from the game.\n\nThe idea that fans think they can pinpoint when a played did steroids is just silly. I am glad fans do this. It's an old-fashioned, passionate way of looking at a game that has passion sucked out of it by modern analytics.
