And more generally, which teams have fewer fans than there exist whatever they're named after?\\n\\nTo start, I needed a rough estimate of the number of NFL fans in the world. This turned out to be difficult to find. I found several reasonable estimates that ranged from 200,000,000 to 400,000,000, but the average estimate seems to be about 300,000,000, so I decided to go with that. If you prefer a different estimate, you can easily scale all of the final numbers up or down as needed.\\n\\nOf those 300,000,000, about [90%](https://www.statista.com/statistics/660525/most-popular-nfl-teams-in-us/), or 270,000,000, consider themselves fans of one team in particular. To find out how these 270,000,000 fans apportion themselves among the 32 teams, I used [this page](http://www.trackalytics.com/the-most-liked-nfl-teams-on-facebook/page/1/), which lists how many likes each team has on Facebook (it lists the St. Louis Rams and the San Diego Chargers but still has accurate numbers for the Facebook likes, I checked), and calculated the total number of likes across the 32 teams: 91,712,968. Then, I took the number of likes for each team and multiplied it by 270,000,000/91,712,968 (then rounded to the nearest whole number) to get the best estimate that I was realistically going to be able to get for the total number of fans that each team has. Here are my results:\\n\\nBears: There are roughly 12,092,476 Bears fans. There are [eight species of bear, plus the grizzly-polar hybrid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bears). I won't go through all of my calculations, but I came up with a final number of 1,148,364. There are more Bears fans than bears.\\n\\nLions: There are roughly 5,642,181 Lions fans. The worldwide lion population is somewhere around [20,000](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/big-cats-initiative/lion-decline-map/). There are more Lions fans than lions.\\n\\nPackers: There are roughly 16,024,215 Packers fans. I don't really feel like doing extensive research on the worldwide meatpacking industry, but the U.S. meatpacking industry employs about 148,100 and there is no way that there are a hundred times that number outside of the country. There are more Packers fans than packers.\\n\\nVikings: There are roughly 6,200,740 Vikings fans. The Viking Age ended nearly a millennium ago. There are more Vikings fans than Vikings.\\n\\nCowboys: There are roughly 25,758,315 Cowboys fans. There are currently [less than 9,730](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy#Modern_working_cowboys) cowboys in the United States. Again, there's no way there are over a thousand times more cowboys elsewhere. There are more Cowboys fans than cowboys.\\n\\nEagles: There are roughly 8,888,974 Eagles fans. This one was a lot harder than I was anticipating, but there are 60 different species of eagle. Two of the most common are the bald eagle (70,000 in the world) and the most common eagle in Europe, the [spotted eagle](http://www.kotkas.ee/species/spotted-eagles) (40,000 in the world). Based on this, I highly doubt that the average eagle species has a worldwide population of more than 100,000, an estimate which would yield a total eagle population across all species of 6,000,000 (remember, this is most likely a wild overestimate). There are almost certainly more Eagles fans than eagles.\\n\\nGiants: There are roughly 11,690,931 Giants fans. Giants are mythological creatures. There are more Giants fans than giants.\\n\\nRedskins: I'm not touching this one.\\n\\nBuccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buccaneer), the term \\\"buccaneer\\\" refers specifically to Caribbean pirates of the 17th and 18th century. They're all dead. There are more Buccaneers fans than buccaneers.\\n\\nFalcons: There are roughly 6,009,462 Falcons fans. The common kestrel (5,000,000 worldwide) and Merlin (1,300,000 worldwide) alone cover this number, according to [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Falconiformes_by_population). There are more falcons than Falcons fans.\\n\\nPanthers: There are roughly 7,034,101 Panthers fans. \\\"Panther\\\" is kind of a loosely defined term, but the genus *Panthera* includes tigers (3,890 worldwide), lions (20,000), jaguars (15,000), leopards (250,000), and snow leopards (6,000). That adds up to 294,890. There are more Panthers fans than panthers.\\n\\nSaints: There are roughly 11,930,352 Saints fans. For this study, I've only been counting living things, and you have to die to become a saint. Not that it really matters, since the Catholic Church has only canonized about 10,000 people anyway. There are more Saints fans than saints.\\n\\n49ers: There are roughly 12,383,284 49ers fans. \\\"49ers\\\" refers to people who partook in the 1849 California gold rush. The oldest living person was born in 1900. All of the 49ers are dead. There are more 49ers fans than 49ers.\\n\\nCardinals: There are roughly 4,279,156 Cardinals fans. There are about 120,000,000 [northern cardinals alone](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Northern_Cardinal/lifehistory). There are more cardinals than Cardinals fans.\\n\\nRams: There are roughly 2,327,583 Rams fans. A ram can refer to either a male sheep or a male goat (note to all of the Patriots fans about to make what they think is a super clever comment: just stop). There are over a billion sheep in the world and nearly as many goats. This isn't even close. There are more rams than Rams fans.\\n\\nSeahawks: There are roughly 11,993,609 Seahawks fans. A seahawk is another name for an osprey, of which there are fewer than 100,000 in the world. There are more Seahawks fans than seahawks.\\n\\nBengals: There are roughly 3,517,293 Bengals fans. There are 2,500 Bengal tigers left (to be honest I'm just going to stop posting sources when the information is a single search away because I'm already tired of this and I still have half the league to go). There are more Bengals fans than Bengals.\\n\\nBrowns: There are roughly 3,738,429 Browns fans for some reason. The Browns are named after someone whose last name was Brown. In the United States, there are about [1,552,500 people](http://www.namestatistics.com/lastname/brown) with that last name. The majority of the people who speak English as a first language live in the United States, so it's very likely that the majority of Browns do as well. There are probably more Browns fans than Browns.\\n\\nRavens: There are roughly 6,927,791 Ravens fans. [There are 20,000,000 common ravens alone.](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Common_Raven/lifehistory). There are more ravens than Ravens fans.\\n\\nSteelers: There are roughly 19,179,380 Steelers fans. There are only about 87,000 or so steel workers in the United States, and I'm just once again going to extrapolate and say that there aren't several hundred times more than that outside of the USA. There are probably more Steelers fans than steelers.\\n\\nBills: There are roughly 2,533,838 Bills fans. The Buffalo Bills were named after Buffalo Bill, so it makes sense to use the number of people named Bill. There are about [3,002,475](http://www.namestatistics.com/firstname/male/william) people in the United States named William. Using the same logic as we did with the Browns suggests that there are roughly twice as many Williams in the world as Bills fans, so we'd need at least half of all Williams to go by Bill. Especially considering how many common nicknames for William there are, this seems unlikely. There are probably more Bills fans than Bills.\\n\\nDolphins: There are roughly 6,637,669 Dolphins fans. I was somewhat surprised to learn this, but we don't really have much of an idea how many dolphins there are in the world (the ocean is, like, really big). My standards for reputable sources have fallen so far at this point in this regrettable project that I'm just going to use [Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-many-dolphins-are-there-in-the-world-1), where \\\"Patricia Barquin, Enthusiast\\\" believes that there are well over seven million. So there are probably more dolphins than Dolphins fans. Whatever.\\n\\nJets: There are roughly 5,824,758 Jets fans. Apparently, there are about 20,000 commercial airplanes in the world. A lot of those are not jets, but there are also a bunch of private jets. Either way, there's no way the number of jets is in the millions. There are more Jets fans than jets.\\n\\nPatriots: There are roughly 20,653,722 Patriots fans. A [Gallup poll from last July](http://www.gallup.com/poll/193379/new-low-extremely-proud-americans.aspx) found that 52% of Americans are proud to be Americans, so there are way more than twenty million people in the U.S. who consider themselves patriots, which is good enough for me. Yeah, we've had an ugly election since then but considering that the president still has an approval rating in the 30s, there's zero chance that the percentage of Americans who are patriots is less than 10%. There are more patriots than Patriots fans.\\n\\nColts: There are roughly 6,689,254 Colts fans. A [Colt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_(horse)) is a male horse under the age of four. There are 58,000,000 horses in the world. The lifespan of a horse in the wild is about 15-20 years (we'll take an average of 17.5 years) and I do not feel like doing in-depth research into the horse industry so I'm just going to assume that the 58,000,000 horses are distributed evenly by sex and age. That would mean 29,000,000 male horses, of which about 6,628,571 would be under the age of four. This is ridiculously close, but using my obviously extremely accurate numbers it looks like there are more Colts fans than colts!\\n\\nJaguars: There are roughly 1,748,475 Jaguars fans, significantly higher than my initial guess of 87. As I said earlier, there are about 15,000 jaguars in the world. There are more Jaguars fans than jaguars.\\n\\nTexans: There are roughly 6,484,945 Texans fans. Texas has a population of about 27,470,000. There are more Texans than Texans fans.\\n\\nTitans: There are roughly 2,737,981 Titans fans. Titans are mythological creatures. There are only 26 of them anyway. There are more Titans fans than Titans.\\n\\nBroncos: There are roughly 13,082,453 Broncos fans. A bronco is apparently just a name for an untrained horse. The vast majority of the world's 58,000,000 horses are domestic horses, and I'm just going to assume that most of those are trained because I don't know why they wouldn't be and also I am extremely sick of looking all of this stuff up. It would be convenient if Reddit had an option to save drafts of posts but it doesn't appear to. Anyway, the vast majority of horses are not broncos, so that means that there are probably more Broncos fans than broncos.\\n\\nChargers: There are roughly 4,700,430 Chargers fans. The Los Angeles Chargers [don't seem to have been named after an actual thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles_Chargers#1960.E2.80.931970:_the_AFL_years), so I'll improvise. I own several chargers. So does everyone I know. Considering how ubiquitous electronic devices are, there have to be billions of chargers. There are more chargers than Chargers fans.\\n\\nChiefs: There are roughly 4,568,973 Chiefs fans. [Chief](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief) is an honorary title used by a lot or organizations, but do they combine to account for one out of every 2000 people or so in the world? I doubt it. There are probably more Chiefs fans than Chiefs.\\n\\nRaiders: There are roughly 10,099,869 Raiders fans. Meanwhile, a \\\"raider\\\" isn't really an actual thing. It's pretty much only used for sports teams. There are more Raiders fans than raiders, I guess.\\n\\n**Summary**: So the teams with fewer fans than their namesakes are:\\n\\nAtlanta Falcons  \\nArizona Cardinals  \\nLos Angeles Rams  \\nBaltimore Ravens  \\nMiami Dolphins  \\nNew England Patriots  \\nHouston Texans  \\nLos Angeles Chargers  \\n\\nMake of that what you will.\\n\\n**Conclusion**: Turns out that there are a lot of birds in the world.\", \"title\": \"[OC]Which teams have fewer fans than their namesake?

Rodgers is not good at football.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n* In addition to his **disgusting 1\\u20134 record in the NFC Championship**, he has an **83.7 passer rating**. He is the equivalent of Jacoby Brissett or Taylor Heinicke in the NFC Championship\\n* Rodgers is one of the least effective pass-catchers in history. **Rodgers is tied with** [**Eric Flowers**](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/F/FlowEr00.htm#all_receiving_and_rushing) **for the 16th fewest receiving yards in history at -11 yards**.

Matt Flynn might be better than Rodgers, I\\u2019m still looking into this. I\\u2019m holding off on my final decision to see what Joe Rogan thinks about it first.\\n* Aaron Rodgers has a birthday coming up on December 2nd. But so do some other people. **Rodgers isn\\u2019t even the best player ever born on December 2nd.** HOF Defensive Back, Willie Brown who has more AP All-Pros (5) than Rodgers (3) and an equal number of Pro-Bowls (9) is the better player born on December 2nd and it\\u2019s not even close. 66% more All-Pros.\\n* **As an owner, Rodgers has been a failure**. His Bears have had **only one season above .500 in the last 9 years.** Their only good season was a mirage in 2018 when they were aided by the easiest schedule in the league and the 2nd best injury luck in the NFL according to Football Outsiders AGL metric.\\n* He is barely over .500 on the road at 55\\u201349. That\\u2019s bad, but it gets really bad when you dig deeper. If you exclude his games at Soldier Field, he is 45\\u201346. **Aaron Rodgers has a losing record on the road against all teams he doesn\\u2019t own.**\\n* He is only 14\\u201313 against the NFC South, and against the AFC East he has a completion % of only 56% and a passer rating of only 88.9\\n* **Aaron Rodgers isn\\u2019t even the best Aaron to ever play in the NFL.** I don\\u2019t think I even need to say this, but the GOAT Aaron is [Aaron Donald](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DonaAa00.htm) and no one could argue against that in good faith. How good are you really, when you aren\\u2019t even the best player using such a narrow qualifier as one\\u2019s own name.\\n* He is only 4\\u20134 against the Falcons, 2\\u20132 against the Bengals, 1\\u20133 against the Colts, 1\\u20133 against the Patriots, 1\\u20131 against the Steelers, 2\\u20133 against the Bucs, 3\\u20133 against the Football Team, and 2\\u20132 against the Titans.\\n* **Rodgers has a career passer rating of only 71.1 against the Bills (3 games) and only 77.9 against the Ravens (3 games).**\\n* **In the playoffs, his passer rating drops by 3.5 points**, which proves he isn\\u2019t ready for the high-pressure moments, which is evident in his 1\\u20134 NFC Championship record.\\n* What\\u2019s more important than digging your team out of a hole when they are backed against their own endzone? **When Rodgers is inside his own 10, he has his lowest rating (by field position splits) at only 89.0** and he has thrown 4 picks in this situation.\\n* Unlike truly great players like Dak Prescott who is 18 for 18 with a 155 passer rating in OT, **Rodgers is only 10 for 18 with a 78.5 passer rating in OT**. His overtime passer rating of 78.5 would place him as the 30th best QB in the league this year, sandwiched between Sam Darnold and Davis Mills\\n* He has had **44 Delay of Game penalties**. I mean, get your shit together, amirite? How hard it is to snap the ball before the clock runs out. 44 times he couldn\\u2019t perform the simplest task in football.\\n* If Aaron Rodgers was so great like the so-called \\u201cexperts\\u201d want you to believe. **You would think he would be the best player ever from fucking Butte Junior College, but he\\u2019s not. Larry Allen is the best player from Butte Junior College.** Larry Allen has had 6 All-Pro selections and 13 Pro Bowl selections compared to Rodgers 3 and 9.\\n* **Should we talk about his other school, Cal? Also not the best player. That would be HOFer Tony Gonzalez** with 6 first-team All-Pro Selections and 14 Pro Bowls.\\n\\nMainstream media and so-called experts are telling you that Aaron Rodgers is very good\\u2026maybe even great. Do your own research, sheeple. It takes just a little bit of critical thinking to realize the truth. Aaron Rodgers simply isn\\u2019t good. If he is so great, then why does he throw interceptions sometimes and why does he lose sometimes?

It seems that unless another player can break a single season record, they won't even be in the discussion for MVP. \\n\\nThe position of quarterback is, in some ways, like pitchers in baseball; they have more control over the game than any other position and are involved in every play every time they are on the field.

I could not find anywhere on the internet where all of the information released so far could be viewed in a seamless manner, so I decided to spend a few hours putting it together myself.\\n\\nI've collected all of the sworn ~~testimonies~~ affidavits, along with statements by relevant parties and other smaller details. I was originally using [this article](https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/deshaun-watson-lawsuit-details/285-42abe4a4-44a9-4acc-b84b-1f18579dff15) for the summaries of each lawsuit, but a few cases into this project I realized that those summaries leave out a lot of important details and some of the JANE DOE's don't match-up, so I ended up drafting most of the summaries myself. I sometimes still used their summary as a skeleton to build off of, so if some of the summaries read like they've been written by two different people, that's why.\\n\\nEach summary includes a link to the full lawsuit. The highlighted portions of each summary are the most important details, if you're just trying to skim. Each summary includes the relevant dates along with the credentials/employment of each JANE DOE, so hopefully some of the rumors claiming that most of these women were \\\"Instagram Hookers\\\" can be put to rest.\\n\\n**Everything is in chronological order based on the dates of the alleged assaults, along with the day-by-day events/statements that have been released the past week. JANE DOE 1 just so happened to be the earliest accusation, JANE DOE 13 was the second earliest, ect.**\\n\\nI have also transcribed Tony Buzbees entire opening statement from his press conference, in case anyone would prefer to read it. I can't fit it into this post but I'll comment it and then link it to the relevant spot.\\n\\nThere will no doubt be mistakes throughout this, my brain did start to overheat towards the last few JANE DOEs. So if you catch any please let me know so that I can correct them.

They arranged it for the 4th, but **Watson did not message the plaintiff until 9PM that night and she did not feel comfortable.** They agreed to do the massage the next day.\\n\\nWatson asked plaintiff if the suite she had rented for the massage was private. She said yes. He insisted on entering through a back door.\\n\\nAt the start, **Watson told her to remove her mask, but she refused** due to COVID regulations that required her to wear it while working with a client.\\n\\n**Watson stripped naked and got on the massage table, which made the plaintiff uncomfortable** so she covered him with a sheet. Eventually he told her to **remove the sheet and \\\"get into his glutes\\\". Plaintiff told Watson that he was not to lay on her table naked.**\\n\\nEventually, while still working on his glutes, **Watson told her to \\\"go deeper\\\" and oil his buttocks. She was uncomfortable but felt she could not afford to upset Watson so she complied. Watson then flipped over and asked her to massage his testicles. She declined, but Watson removed the sheet anyway and exposed his penis to her. He then put his penis on her hand as she tried to cover him, which shocked her and made her recoil.**\\n\\nWatson realized that the plaintiff was not going to do what he wanted, so he paid her and left.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\\\_\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**MARCH 16TH:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- JANE DOE 1 LAWSUIT FILED\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTONY BUZBEE STATEMENT:\\n\\n\\\"I am extremely proud to represent those who have no perceived power  against those who have PERCEIVED power. Things are changing in this  country, in this great state, and in this great city. And I feel like  it\\u2019s for the better, for all of us! Today we filed suit against Deshaun  Watson. Too many times women have put up with behavior that we all know  no one should put up with. Should we make excuses for the famous? Or  those who hold special positions, or quarterbacks on a local  professional football team? I don\\u2019t think so! All people are equal, and  all deserve dignity and respect. My dad was a butcher. My mother drove  my school bus and worked in the snack bar. Knowing what I know now: My  momma had more dignity in her pinky finger than most executives or  coaches or politicians or famous athletes have in their whole bodies!  This case we just filed against Watson isn\\u2019t about money\\u2014it\\u2019s about  dignity and stopping behavior that should be stopped, NOW! Stay tuned  for details. LET ME SAY THIS. I\\u2019m a Marine. I\\u2019m not easily intimidated.  If you have info or have been part of this, contact my office:  txattorneys.com.\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDESHAUN WATSON STATEMENT:\\n\\n\\\"As a result of a social media post by a publicity-seeking plantiffs lawyer, I recently became aware of a lawsuit that has apparently been filed against me. I have not yet seen the complaint, but I know this: I have never treated any woman with anything other than the utmost respect. The plantiff's lawyer claims that this isn't about money, but before filing suit he made a baseless six-figure settlement demand, which I quickly rejected. Unlike him, this isn't about money for me - it's about clearing my name, and I look forward to doing that.\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n**MARCH 17TH:**\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTONY BUZBEE STATEMENT:\\n\\n\\\"My associate, Cornelia, and I will file the second of  what is now four cases on behalf of women against Deshaun Watson today.  The cases allege assault. We won't share the alleged details here, and  we won't try the case in the press, but the cases are publicly filed for  all to see. I appreciate the calls of support that we have received  from those who support these brave women. It takes a lot of guts to  stand up to the powerful, when you are perceived powerless.  Since  filing the first case yesterday, I have had several death threats and  multiple people have harassed my children. The blame the victim (or her  lawyers) mentality is alive and well!! I love football as much as the  next person (although I've never been a Texans fan.) But I don't love it  that much!! Makes me shake my head that people are so passionate about  football to the point of irrationality, while at the same time they  could care less who the mayor or president will be.\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\- JANE DOE 2 LAWSUIT FILED\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTONY BUZBEE STATEMENT:\\n\\n\\\"Third lawsuit of now six to be filed,  against Deshaun Watson, alleging assault. This one is the most  egregious, to date. Again, I won't share details here, but we have open  courts in our Texas Constitution, meaning all lawsuits are public  record. Our staff has received numerous calls. We screen each one, and I  personally talk with and screen any individual on whose behalf we file.  I've been doing this a long time. I don't need \\\"fame,\\\" and, to be quite  honest, and I say this as modestly as I can, if I never made another  penny I would be quite okay. Point is, I'm not pursuing these cases for  the money, and every woman who has filed thus far has only plead the  minimum amount to invoke the court's jurisdiction ($500). This isn't  about the money!! And to be clear: I\\u2019ve had many high profile cases in my life. I represented a sitting governor when he faced life in prison.  I\\u2019ve represented widows, orphans, amputees, and those horribly burned or  injured. As lead, I\\u2019ve handled many mass torts and class actions  recovering hundreds of millions of dollars.  I\\u2019ve tried and won some of  the largest cases in Texas history. But, I will say I\\u2019ve never faced the  nastiness and vitriol I\\u2019ve experienced in this case. People are crazy!  Threatening my kids? People I know? Threatening my fianc\\u00e9? Telling me  they will kill me or they hope I die? All because of football?? Get a  grip!! Yet: We won\\u2019t be deterred or intimidated by key board warriors.  As a Recon Marine I\\u2019ve seen danger\\u2014I\\u2019m not at all concerned by dumb  shits with a keyboard. Haha.  I\\u2019ll continue to proudly represent those who are written off and marginalized in our society.

It takes courage for women to come forward to report  being mistreated, particularly when they attach their names to a  lawsuit. We do not take these allegations lightly. However, fairness to  the accused is equally as important.\\n\\nOpposing counsel has orchestrated a circus-like atmosphere by using social media  to publicize 14 'Jane Doe' lawsuits during the past seven days in a  manner calculated to inflame the public and malign Deshaun\\u2019s otherwise sterling reputation. In addition, the tactic of refusing our requests to  confidentially provide the names of the plaintiffs so we can fully  investigate their claims makes uncovering the truth extremely difficult. Anonymity is often necessary as a shield for victims but opposing  counsel has used it as a sword to publicly humiliate Deshaun before the truth seeking process can even begin.\\n\\nI believe that any allegation that Deshaun forced a woman to commit a  sexual act is completely false. And in the one case in which we have  been able to identify a plaintiff, we have strong evidence showing the  allegation is false. In January of this year, a woman attempted to  blackmail Deshaun by demanding $30,000 in exchange for her \\\"indefinite silence\\\" about what she stated was a consensual encounter. It is our belief this woman is the plaintiff in Cause No. 2021-15613. (Please see the attached declaration by Bryan Burney.) This calls into question the legitimacy of the other cases as well.\\n\\nWe have received numerous unsolicited comments in the past week from many licensed massage  therapists who have worked with Deshaun in recent years. These women  describe him as a gentleman and a model client who never engaged in inappropriate conduct. Indeed, before these salacious claims, everyone who associated with Deshaun described him as an outstanding, respectful,  and compassionate man.\\n\\nAgain, we are taking the allegations very seriously but we ask only that people not rush to judgment, that people not be unduly influenced by opposing counsel's antics, and that they let fundamental fairness to both sides rule the day. Thank you for your  patience and understanding.\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBRYAN BURNEY DECLARATION (Deshaun Watson's equipment manager):\\n\\n\\\"1. My name is Bryan Burney. I am the marketing manager for Houston  Texans quarterback Deshaun Watson, and have had this role for more than  three years. I have personal knowledge of the facts stated in this  declaration; they are true and correct.\\n\\n2. In mid-January 2021, I spoke with an individual who I believe  is the Plaintiff, identified as \\u201cJane Doe,\\u201d in Jane Doe v. Deshaun  Watson, Cause No. 2021-15613 **\\\\[ JANE DOE 3 \\\\]**, currently pending in Harris County, Texas.  It is clear to me that the person I spoke with met with Deshaun on  December 28, 2020, the same day that Jane Doe contends in her petition  that she met with Deshaun. When I spoke with Ms. Doe in January, she  stated that she wanted a \\u201csettlement\\u201d from Deshaun, though what exactly  she wished to \\u201csettle\\u201d was not clear to me.\\n\\n3. During my discussions with Ms. Doe, I questioned the factual  basis for the \\u201csettlement\\u201d that she was requesting from Deshaun. Ms. Doe  informed me that she was asking to be paid $30,000 for what she  referred to as \\u201cindefinite silence\\u201d about her encounter with Deshaun. I  asked her what she would be silent about and whether anything had  happened with Deshaun against her will. She confirmed that everything  that occurred was consensual during her encounter with Deshaun. I asked  Ms. Doe why Deshaun should pay for silence regarding something that was  consensual \\u2013 whatever it was. She said that it was a matter that both  she and Deshaun would wish to keep secret and that she would need to be  paid for her \\u201csilence.\\u201d\\n\\n4. After my conversation with Ms. Doe, I received a call from a  man purporting to be her \\u201cbusiness manager.\\u201d Ms. Doe\\u2019s business manager  told me that her encounter with Deshaun would be embarrassing if  revealed and that Deshaun should pay to keep the matter secret.\\n\\n5. I told this individual that his demand to be paid for not  revealing a consensual interaction between two adults was extortion.\\n\\n6. He responded, \\u201cIt\\u2019s not extortion, it\\u2019s blackmail.\\u201d\\n\\n7. I informed this individual that Deshaun would not be paying the $30,000 requested.\\n\\n8. In the years that I have known Deshaun, I have known him to be a  respectful, decent human being. I do not believe him capable of the  conduct that \\u201cJane Doe\\u201d has anonymously accused him of in this case.  This conduct is also completely inconsistent with multiple statements  made by Jane Doe and by her \\u201cbusiness manager,\\u201d indicating that her  encounter with Deshaun involved only consensual activity.\\\"\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nTONY BUZBEE STATEMENT:\\n\\n\\u201cAlleged sexual misconduct is serious. Attempting to criminalize or minimize those that speak out or step forward is wrong. I have been asked to respond to a released statement by Mr. Watson\\u2019s counsel.\\n\\nMy first reaction is that there have been so many massage sessions from Instagram that Mr. Watson can\\u2019t keep track of them\\u2014recall he, on Twitter, initially criticized me and denied everything. I can\\u2019t tell you how many people have stepped forward to report similar conduct or provide information. That info will be released, again in public filings\\u2014not in the media.\\n\\nMy second reaction is a question: why would his marketing agent admit Watson had sex for pay with a massage therapist, consensual or otherwise? We will also provide a copy of the non-disclosure agreement that Deshaun Watson and his marketing manager repeatedly insisted that Jane Doe (and others) sign after (and sometimes before) the \\u201cmassage session,\\u201d which she refused to sign.\\n\\nI do appreciate Mr. Hardin\\u2019s professionalism and his words of support for victims, but would respectfully suggest there are many facts here, that we will put in public filings, that Mr. Hardin might not be aware of. We will provide additional details in a statement, consistent with our ethical obligations in due course. I\\u2019m hoping we can do so by Friday.\\\"\", \"title\": \"Deshaun Watson Allegations - A detailed chronological timeline of all lawsuits, statements, and events.\", \"id\": \"md9av6\", \"score\": 16817, \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/md9av6/deshaun_watson_allegations_a_detailed/\", \"permalink\": \"/r/nfl/comments/md9av6/deshaun_watson_allegations_a_detailed/\"}, {\"selftext\": \"\", \"title\": \"[Highlight] Niners special teams block a punt, return it for a touchdown\", \"id\": \"sakdn1\", \"score\": 16802, \"url\": \"https://streamable.com/6cefv0\", \"permalink\": \"/r/nfl/comments/sakdn1/highlight_niners_special_teams_block_a_punt/\"}, {\"selftext\": \"\", \"title\": \"[Bryant] I get on twitter to laugh joke & spit real life shit with people but I\\u2019m being very clear with you skip bayless...

I think what made it so easy for everyone at the time, was that there was still an underlying expectation that at some point he would be signed by a team; and for maybe a moment, his life would turn back towards his gifts as an uncanny talent in the NFL. Well that moment never happened. Antonio was never signed by a team, and his life became more complicated as a result. I feel like once it sunk in to him that he wouldn't play again this season(and at this point, it looks unlikely he will play again), he began to spiral. I know what that feeling is like. When i realized my playing days were over, I spiraled hard. I felt like I had another 2-3 seasons left in me, and it was a crashing down to earth that no amount of weed was going to soften for the foreseeable future. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n   For my first 2 years of not being signed and staring at those NFLPA papers for retirement; I can only tell you that most days were a daze. I hardly remember anything other than weed, and videogames. I couldn't tell you if it was a Monday or a Sunday. I didn't much give a damn anyways. I hardly slept, rarely communicated more than necessary, and argued with my wife constantly. I'm sure over petty and nonsensical things. There was just a huge void in my life. My wife could see it, my dog too. I was trying to play things off but anyone who really knew me could tell. Anytime football would come on, I would leave the room. Anytime someone asked me why I wasn't still playing, and awkward, uncomfortable tick in my neck. For me it was sort of like PTSD. I could not be around football, it induced anxiety almost instantly. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n   I started to do things I wouldn't normally do, I started drinking(I was a rare drinker before) heavily. I would stay awake until 5-6 am just because. I sought isolation and lashed out at people who tried to tell me I was not myself. I see a lot of those things happening with Antonio. For me, I didn't begin to pick up the mental pieces in my mind until I started seeing a therapist. 6 months straight before I took a break. That was just the beginning for me in finding a new path for myself in life, but it was an absolutely important step that was the catalyst for everything else that I moved toward in my life. I doubt I would be writing this today if I hadn't got myself therapy for the issues I was dealing with back then. \\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n  I really feel for AB and while it is a mess of his own making, there is still a man down there behind all of that bravado and pride. And I hope that he will finally look in the mirror, and fight to get things back straight in his life. Hopefully this is finally his rock bottom.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\-The Observant Lineman\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh1eMGH-Ek0&feature=share](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lh1eMGH-Ek0&feature=share)\", \"title\": \"Its EASY to pile on Antonio Brown, but lets all hope that this is the WAKE-UP call that can get his life and mental health back on track.

Jameis Winston\\u2019s career earnings at this point add up to $46,180,894. \\n\\nThe lengths at which Jameis has taken his charitable habits are impressive, but to truly highlight his contributions, let\\u2019s take a look at some other recent players who have taken it upon themselves to give back to their communities. \\n\\n\\nIn 2012, the Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh donated $2,000,000 to the University of Nebraska athletic department and another $600,000 to the engineering department to fund an endowment, totaling $2,600,000. Nothing to scoff at.\\n\\n\\nIn 2017, Chris Long, donated his entire base salary (worth $1,000,000) to charity to help fund scholarships for his hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia.\\n\\n\\nIn 2018, JJ Watt, raised $41,600,000 for the relief effort following Hurricane Harvey, supporting communities in Houston by rebuilding homes and providing for families in need.\\n\\n\\nJust recently in 2020, current teammate Drew Brees donated $5,000,000 to the state of Louisiana to help with the COVID-19 pandemic. \\n\\n\\nCombining the donations of Suh, Long, Watt, and Brees totals to $50,200,000. \\nWould you believe that to date Jameis has donated over 3 times that much money? Jameis knew he could never become the most charitable player of all time based on his career earnings so he decided to make history another way... \\n\\n\\nYou\\u2019re probably saying to yourself, \\u201cBut /u/blkharedgrl, how is this possible? I haven\\u2019t heard about this on the news,  NFL network, or r/NFL.\\u201d That\\u2019s because those so called news organizations are fake news and won\\u2019t televise Jameis Winston\\u2019s revolution. Rather, they won\\u2019t televise the effects of Jameis Winston\\u2019s revolution. Let\\u2019s take a closer look at how Jameis Winston became the Mr. Deeds of the NFL.\\n\\n\\nDuring the 2019-20 NFL season Jameis Winston became the first QB to ever throw 30 touchdowns and 30 interceptions. When Jameis threw those interceptions he didn\\u2019t do it for the fame, or the glory, OR even because he couldn\\u2019t see who he was throwing to. He did it because he has a heart of gold and is such a generous young man. Every time he donated the ball to the other team he took from his own extension and gave to those that were less fortunate.\\n\\nOf the 28 players that intercepted Jameis, 7 of them received contract extensions and 1 of them (Richard Sherman) hit a contract bonus.\\n\\nPlayer|Contract Years|Contract Value|Guaranteed Money\\n---|---|----|----\\nRichard Sherman|N/A|$3,000,000*|$3,000,000|\\nMarcus Peters|3|$42,000,000|$32,468,118|\\nJames Bradberry|3|$43,500,000|$31,980,000|\\nVonn Bell|3|$18,000,000|$3,000,000|\\nP.J. Williams|1|$2,007,500|$2,007,500|\\nDesmond Trufant|2|$20,000,000|$14,000,000|\\nDe'Vondre Campbell|1|$6,000,000|$6,000,000|\\nBradley Roby|3|$31,500,500|$19,000,000|\\nTotal|N/A|$166,008,000|$109,450,126|\\n*Richard Sherman making All-Pro and the Pro Bowl are a direct result of his pick-six in Week 1 as it was 33% of his interceptions for the 2019-2020 season.\\n\\n\\nJameis signed a 1 year contract for $1,100,000 with the Saints, but as a result of his generous donations to players like Marcus Peters and Bradley Roby he was able to generate almost 151 times more for others than himself. \\n\\nMuch like how Jesus was able to feed thousands with only 7 loaves of bread and 2 fish, Jameis was able to feed 8 players with 9 interceptions.

Actual post.\\n\\nhttps://old.reddit.com/r/DynastyFF/comments/ws2gb7/stop_freaking_out_about_brady_hes_just_off/\\n\\n(Theory and wild speculation)\\n\\nSo, upon seeing the Shefty report earlier this evening about Todd Bowles not having a definite timeline about when Brady would return to camp, I joked to a buddy that Brady was probably just off doing the Masked Singer or something. The more that i thought about it, the more logical it seemed.\\n\\nBackground: From what i understand about the Masked Singer (I haven't actually watched it so could be very off on any of the details), the contestants' identities remain a secret throughout the entire show, so Brady couldn't just say \\\"im going on the Masked Singer\\\" without ruining the big reveal. This could explain why the reports of Brady taking a leave of absence were so vague and the only reports were that it was to \\\"deal with personal things.\\\" I'm sure Brady and any other possible contestants would have been required to sign an NDA to be on the show. It was also explained in those reports that the absence was known about and approved in advance by the team, which would also make sense. A casting/filming deal with a TV studio would have to be set up months in advance to align schedules, set the cast, etc. Brady could have agreed to be on the show back when he was briefly retired and then still had it as an obligation to be fulfilled upon rejoining the team. The leave of absence could have been a condition to him coming back. All of this is clearly speculation, but i started to really believe this was the reason for his leave of absence. So i decided to do some research.\\n\\nInteresting factoid #1: In May 2022, Brady signed a 10 year, $375 million deal with Fox Sports to be their main NFL analyst once he retires. What channel does the Masked Singer air on? You guessed it, it airs on FOX. The same channel Brady will be calling NFL games on once he retires. If this wasn't enough, a little google search let me know that Joe Buck appeared on the Masked Singer in Season 7 while he was the main NFL Color Commentator for Fox Sports. So the precedent is there.\\n\\n2 - the smoking gun: Next i decided to google Masked Singer filming dates and came across a nifty little site where you can sign up sit in the audience for the filming of The Masked Singer. Lo and behold, right on the main page it shows that there is a filming session supposed to occur on August 20. That is the exact same date as the Bucs-Titans preseason game, you know, the one which Brady said he would definitely be out through. What a coincidence! The next thing i found almost blew the rails off this whole theory. On the same site mentioned above, you can see any of the previous filming dates. Those dates were July 24-29, August 2-9, and August 12-20. Well dern, the Bucs started training camp on July 27 and Brady was in attendance until August 10, so doesn't seem likely that he was filming for the Masked Singer. That is until i did some more research and learned another interesting fact. Not all contestants are on every episode. Wikipedia let me know that in Season 7 (the most recent season) there were 15 contestants on the show. 5 appeared in the first three episodes, a different 5 appeared on the next three episodes, and the final five appeared on the next three episodes. The winner from each group moved on to a final round/episode. So it could be very likely that the July 24-29 and August 2-9 filming dates consisted of the first 10 contestants, and the August 12-20 filming sessions consisted of the final 5, which Brady could be apart of. Lets see how those last filming dates line up with Brady's leave of absence. From the initial report, Brady missed practice on Thursday, August 11 and will be out until at least Saturday, August 20 (the bucs titans preseason game). The August 12-20 filming dates just so happen to fit perfectly into that leave of absence. Just a crazy coincidence im sure! One last comment that further fits my theory: the report today was that Bowles has \\\"no definitive date\\\" for Brady's return other than that it would be after the Titans game. If Brady advanced out of his theoretical group of 5 contestants, he would need to film one more episode for the finale - but there's no way to know up front if he would make it or not, leading to the \\\"indefinite\\\" return date.\\n\\nTLDR- My theory is that Brady's leave of absence is to film for the Masked Singer, to fulfill an obligation he signed up for during his brief retirement. There is possible evidence to support this.\\n\\nTLDRDR: buy low on Brady\\n\\nThis is my first attempt at internet sleuthing, so there could very well be something obvious that I'm overlooking that would easily dispel this theory, so just let me know if i missed something. Otherwise, stop freaking out about Brady - he doesn't need preseason.\\n\\nAlso - if you watch the Masked Singer and hate spoilers, I'm sorry.\", \"title\": \"Stop freaking out about Brady, he's just off filming for the Masked Singer\", \"id\": \"wsffcg\", \"score\": 12457, \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/wsffcg/stop_freaking_out_about_brady_hes_just_off/\", \"permalink\": \"/r/nfl/comments/wsffcg/stop_freaking_out_about_brady_hes_just_off/\"}, {\"selftext\": \"\", \"title\": \"[Tapp] Tyreek Hill said DK Metcalf made a nice play but he would never do that because his QB doesn't throw picks\", \"id\": \"jl42c9\", \"score\": 12450, \"url\": \"https://twitter.com/codybtapp/status/1322243314356281349?s=21\", \"permalink\": \"/r/nfl/comments/jl42c9/tapp_tyreek_hill_said_dk_metcalf_made_a_nice_play/\"}, {\"selftext\": \"\", \"title\": \"[Meirov] Joe Burrow says Evan McPherson came up and said \\u201clooks like we\\u2019re going to the AFC Championship Game\\u201d right before he went out to kick the 52-yard game-winner.

I was hoping some of you may have dealt with this before, or maybe even know someone that could get this resolved. At the very least this can be a warning about StubHub.\\n\\nI recently purchased tickets for the Cowboys upcoming playoff game, where I was planning on flying in to go to the game with a friend i hadn't seen in years. It's pretty expensive all together, but given how unique of a time this could be for the Cowboys, and the fact that I hadn't seen my friend in a while I figured it was worth it. To say I was a bit excited would be an understatement. \\n\\nUnfortunately, when the tickets were delivered today it was clear that they were marked for 2016. Shit, but oh well, StubHub has the fan protect guarantee, and it's not their fault some jerk scammed me. Here's one of the tickets I got. http://imgur.com/a/DfqgI\\n\\nSo i call in and i'm told it's just a misprint. Okay- maybe it is, but it felt weird so i did some more research. With the help of the r/cowboys, it was clear that these were last years tickets. Here's a picture proving it http://imgur.com/a/bmIRb\\n\\nAnd here's what they should look like http://imgur.com/a/oyXXb\\n\\nArmed with this evidence I called back figuring that this has to be overwhelming proof I received illegitimate tickets. Nope- they still claimed it was a misprint. A misprint that just so happened to have the exact same look as last years and the same date. They will only offer me a refund if I go to the venue and get rejected. However, I'm flying in for the game, which means I will have to spend hundreds of dollars just to make sure I get a refund.\\n\\nI'm not sure what to do at this point, i've tried reaching out on facebook, but they're still just telling me misprint even stating, \\\"Our Facebook & Twitter team is one in the same; no different answer will be provided.\\\" \\n\\nDo you all have any suggestions for how I can possibly get this resolved? Right now I'm disappointed and a bit lost at how to move forward. These were by far the most expensive tickets i've ever purchased, so i feel pretty devastated. \\n\\nThanks! \\n\\nEDIT: Thank you all so much for your support and help! Even though it sounds cliche, I am truly shocked by this outpouring. To those asking about Ticket Exchange I have now tried it and the tickets are indeed invalid. \\n\\n\\nEDIT 2: I wanted to let everyone know that StubHub did reach out to me and we had a conversation this morning. After further review- they determined these were indeed last years tickets, and as a result they are providing me new tickets in an adjacent section. \\n\\nThe support rep I spoke to was very courteous, and I really appreciate StubHub honoring their Fan Guarantee at the end of the day, but i'm still frustrated it took this type of social media showing to get them to correct something that was clearly wrong. I hope moving forward that they implement escalation procedures, so that fans like me don't feel completely left out in the cold when something happens.  \\n\\nThank you all so much for your help! This never would have been possible with out you all reaching out and putting your weight behind this situation. \\n\\nAnd finally....

I want to come at this head on with a logical and reasonable response. So with all that being said, these are my feelings, and my views on this situation. \\n\\nDeSean Jackson, in my opinion deserves to be suspended by the NFL. He also deserves to be released by the Philadelphia Eagles. I wouldn't blame them for it if they did, however it's not my call, nor is it anyone else's outside of those who make decisions in Philadelphia. Namely the owner of the team  Jeff Lurie. What he posted in regards to the Jewish community, in some kind of ill- advised attempt at motivating black America in awakening to some notion of religious divine destiny was both irresponsible, and woefully ignorant. I believe that regardless of his intent, regardless of his inability to provide any context(as he has since stated to Shannon Sharpe that  his true message was that of black empowerment and unity.) and his total lack of awareness as to the rules of online etiquette(especially in hyper sensitive 2020) show that he was reckless in thinking that he was somehow providing an uplifting statement  that would garner praise from his audience for his \\\"woke\\\" post. I am supremely disappointed that a man who has found so much success on and off the field as a 13 year professional in the NFL could allow himself to be placed in such a situation.  We have been trained on this. In the NFL we are trained each and every year about the DANGERS of social media. We have been drilled in a sense, about online interactions.  Think twice before you hit SEND. And if you really have to think twice, you probably shouldn't post it at all. \\n\\nLets begin with what should have been the MOST OBVIOUS red flag apparent to DeSean from the outset of this entire debacle:\\n\\n*\\\"Hitler said.\\\"*\\n\\nRight then and there is when the entire thought process of sending any kind of message whatsoever should have ceased to exist. PERIOD. FULL STOP. It does not matter where you thought you were going with this, those two words should have instantaneously disrupted any notion that I might want to hear this thing out and see if I can vibe with it. So you know what that tells me? DeSean is unaware of what exactly makes Adolf Hitler's perspective utterly repulsive to what I would assume is 99.999% of the world population at large. Either he is not aware of the overall history behind the last true battle between good and evil in this world, or he was just stupid enough to post something without actually reading it or giving much more thought than, \\\"Its someone else holding my people back. It's a conspiracy.\\\" In that, I will give DeSean the benefit of the doubt in my assumption that he does not know his history.  But that would also mean that since he does not know his history, he also cannot know for sure that what he is posting is even an accurate quote that can be directly attributed to the person with which it is supposed to have originated from.  That means DeSean was being lazy.\\n\\nThat brings me to my next point.\\n\\n DeSean posted a quote that was never actually said by Adolf Hitler. Once again, a total lack of awareness  in that he did not check his post for accuracy before posting it. That, in my opinion is not a total deal breaker in the grand scheme of stupidity, because I think its fair to say that all of us who use social media have fallen prey to the fake quote that we read, or even post and think, \\\"hey, that sounds like something there.\\\" from time to time. It would be a lot more reassuring had DJax not chosen Adolf Hitler as the quote to grasp onto, but that milk has already been spilt.\\n\\nThis next view will likely be unpopular among my people in the black community, and brothers in the league. Or maybe it wont, but I will say it regardless.\\n\\nDeSean should be held to the same standards that we hold any other individual who would have made a similar mistake(willfully or ignorantly).  I have heard NOTHING from my brothers in the league denouncing this post. The silence is DEAFENING. Let's be real for a second. Had Julian Edelman posted a picture of a quote(fake quote or not) that offered a similar perspective in reverse, presenting a narrative for Jewish people in maintaining dominance because they were superior to black people, we would be AT HIS HEAD 24/7. We would demand that he be disciplined in the harshest way imaginable for posting something so utterly ridiculous. Hold DeSean to the same standard. HOLD HIM TO THE SAME STANDARD. Denounce what he did. DEMAND PITTANCE BE PAID, and THEN educate him and open his mind up to understand better how to try to express himself when he wants to send an uplifting message.  Malcolm Jenkins said that, \\\" Comments were made...and they were wrong.\\\" I say- bullshit. He almost brushed aside completely the fact that one of our brothers went off and said some downright stupid ass shit(excuse my French) that is making him look like an uninformed bigot and you have the nonchalant demeanor of someone who is only concerned about a certain agenda. Jenkins said, \\\"We gotta stay focused...\\\" I think its about as TONE DEAF as Drew Brees was in his comments. You pivot around the fact that a brother is in an obviously ugly situation, and it is actually our duty to set the record straight by calling what he did for what it is. We in the NFL community can bring him back into the fold and educate him, but WE OWE IT to guys like Julian Edelman,  Mitchell Schwartz , and other Jewish players within our NFL world to CALL IT OUT, DENOUNCE IT FULLY, and  SHOW OUR SUPPORT for educating ourselves and allowing our brothers(of all ethnic backgrounds) to help provide more knowledge within, whether it be Jewish culture or any other ethnic culture in our society. To have the nerve to go online and say this is a distraction is a slap in the face of those who have stood with us as allies in our fight to  root out racism in this 2020 age of the Black Lives Matter movement. Anything less in my opinion is hypocrisy. I was taken aback by Malcolm's belittling response to this situation. I don't know Malcolm, I have no issue with him personally. However he has got to do better in regard to his Instagram video. It was embarrassing to me to watch someone who stood up and took aim against his own teammate not 45 days ago for his tone deafness, now sitting in front of a camera with all of his expanding platform, refusing to bring that same resolve and frustration to the table when it involves one of our own. I can't vibe with that.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nDo I believe DeSean Jackson is a bigot or racist? No. I do not believe that at all. I admit I don't know him at all. What I do know is a person's history paints the best picture possible in gaining a fraction of an understanding of who they are. His history, in the public eye at least, shows nothing that would lead me to assume he has bigoted or racist views. What I do think is that DeSean was almost laughably(in the saddest way possible) ill-informed, gullible(we all can be at times) and unimaginably shortsighted  in the fact that he didn't think for one second that maybe he should research the validity of the post he was retweeting before he co-signed to a message that has already been fully set in it's own optic path, without regard for how he sees it, or intends to present it. You can't do that. When you want to send a message to the world, send it CLEARLY, and with context. Do not allow the world to provide context for you, because you then roll the dice and are vulnerable to the online mob that social media has become.  I got nothing but love for you DJax, I hope that you learn from this and you grow from it. I feel that we all should seek educating of one's self to be a better person today than we were yesterday. I know that this will be a hard situation to face individually and I definitely offer up myself to have a conversation with you because I want you to continue to thrive as a professional and as a person. Let this serve as a lesson, and let it change you in whatever way it organically will. Much love brother. Much love to everyone in the world.  Its been one hell of a year(in the apocalyptic, \\\"whats next, aliens?\\\" kind of way), lets circle the wagons, lock arms, and start walking in the same direction as a society. It won't be comfortable all the time, but lets start opening our ears and our hearts before we open our mouths.
