Also varied up the speed of his serves on the 2nd serve, to keep Novak off-guard. Went for the down-the-line ace, or service winner, whenever possible.\n* Hit the balls very deep and flat (as expected), but took off considerable pace, thus forcing Novak to put in more pace than he is accustomed to doing (Djokovic very happy to feast off of opponents' pace). This had the accumulated effect, of forcing Novak to expend considerably more energy for every groundstroke. It actually ends up not being a mere \"tactic\", but actually a \"strategic\" move, as it preempts Novak's entire game plan of \"drop-a-set-as-needed, then come back\" ability: if you're forced to use a lot more energy on every point merely hitting back shots, your \"reserve tank\" for the \"come back\" is also being drained ...\n* Used drop shots, to cut out Novak's legs from under him (Novak has spend a lot of time running on-court, and no one, not even Joker or Rafa, have unlimited reserves of energy, especially not in their twilight years). Even if Novak gets to them, this kind of pressure builds up in your legs over time (tires them out) -- Djokovic gave Daniil the unexpected, but very welcome, \"gifts\" of fumbling the vast majority of those drop shots, even (especially!) the really bad ones. \n* Was never afraid to go for the big strike, as needed: whenever they had long rallies, Daniil struck, and struck big and hard, as he felt necessary. No second-guessing or doubts, but strong, powerful finishes -- sending the message to Djokovic, that if he wants to win important rallies, he really, really has to put in the roadwork: no freebies, here. Lots of carefully-timed hitting behind Novak, to boot. \n\nAll in all, a masterclass performance from Daniil, who won not only against Djokovic, but against a crowd either hungry for more tennis, or wanted Djokovic to win, and very probably both.\n\nIf there is a book written on \"how to completely dismantle Novak Djokovic's game\", then it is Daniil Medvedev, rather than \"Fedal + rest of field\" that has written it today, here at the US Open.

Having maintained a top-50 ranking for more than three-and-a-half years, Evans is well placed to advise the underperforming rump of British tennis.\n\n\u201cI think players need to compete more week in week out,\u201d said Evans after his 6-3, 6-2 defeat in Madrid. \u201cThe players need to get out on the road and just get after it. It's not like there's great science behind it. I mean, it can hard on the tour but you need to be at it.\n\n\u201cI'm never going to say I'm a blueprint,\u201d Evans added, \u201cbut James Ward \u2013 when he made it to 80 in the world \u2013 was playing in Challengers and Futures events week in week out. Cam [Norrie] learned his trade by playing his matches and being in competitive situations. He's not got good on the practice court. He plays his tournaments, he sticks to his schedule, he's never injured \u2013 touch wood \u2013 and how that's not a blueprint is beyond me, basically.\u201d\n\nIt is on the women\u2019s side that things look bleak. Emma Raducanu\u2019s run of seven weeks without a win means that there will be no Briton in the top 100 in the next set of WTA rankings. For the last time that was true, you have to go back to May 2008.\n\n\u201c[As a nation], we're picking and choosing what tournaments we play,\u201d said Evans, \u201cand we're ranked 200 in the world. I'm not going to bag the girls here but no one played after [the Billie Jean King Cup in Coventry a fortnight ago]. There\u2019s some cultural thing about resting and all that. It's not new.

Since its finals season its hard to find anyone to play with and I want to spend the time getting better at things like the basic swings and footwork patterns.\n\nCan you guys share some videos or articles that detail the basic shots/swing mechanics? Coming from years of Squash, I think I will adapt well by just watching a video and get started for the time being (not implying anything about a carryover but that years of self-teaching proper squash technique has meant I can understand intricacies pretty well and can somewhat get to proper motions without the need of a coach). I will soon get a few lessons too.\n\nI tried looking for some myself but there are tons of videos out there and many concepts such as a 'beginner' forehand, then a standard forehand, top spin, easter/western grips, multiple ways of approaching the same shot. In squash we typically have a forehand shot and a backhand shot w a similar grip alongside volleys and drops so its easier to figure out which videos to start with as a beginner.\n\nMany thanks in advance.", "spoiler": false, "title": "Resources to learn proper form", "upvote_ratio": 0.67, "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/tennis/comments/1350lw6/resources_to_learn_proper_form/", "comments": [{"body": "Check out top tennis training on YT"}, {"body": "I recommend feel tennis instruction. I feel like that the techniques taught on that channel is much more replicable and simple to learn. Groundstroke technique has gotten so complicated, especially at the pro level. I feel like it confuses new players. Simple is better tbh\n\nTo answer some of your questions, the most common grip in modern tennis is the semiwestern grip. With your squash background, i would recommend an eastern grip. It seems like squash uses a shakehand grip, which in tennis terms is a continental grip. However, the continental grip is not used for fh groundstrokes in tennis. Try eastern or semiwestern out to see what you like. \n\nThe backhand grip will depend on whether you want to learn a one handed or two handed bh. Topspin is when you brush up on the ball, making the ball spin forward. Backspin is slicing the ball, spinning the opposite way"}, {"body": "I learned a lot from 2MinuteTennis on youtube.

Clay courts can build up in places and hollow out in others, and is in general not perfectly level, therefore absolutely minute differences in how high above the ground the ball is can occur. \n\nIt's still unbelievably accurate, even on clay, because these variations are so tiny, and the lines themselves don't move, so this ball is in, but it's disingenuous to say that the court surface changes NOTHING."]}, {"body": "This has been discussed many times.\n\nThe technology is weird on clay and they don't want to use it BECAUSE THE REAL MARKS LEFT BY THE BALL MAKE IT LOOK AS IF THE BALL LANDED FARTHER THAN IT ACTUALLY DID.

Yeah, there is a \"physical mark\" on the ground but the rules isnt that those marks overturn the calls themselves. An umpires  could use whatever judgment they wanted to correct the call of a line judge. But of course, umpires and players would constantly butt heads over whether a given mark showed the ball as in or out as umpires have certain metrics they would use to decide such things that the players weren't always in agreement with.\n\nBut thats irrelevant now.

In terms of analyzing technique like you want, they sometimes make a comment or two about it when discussing the player's strengths and weaknesses. But there are so many factors when hitting a tennis ball, so when someone misses a shot, it's almost impossible to pinpoint exactly why they missed that shot.\n\nYou should also realize that it's really difficult to analyze matches in real time.

I plan to play long-term with friends and family for recreational purposes rather than pursuing competitive titles.\n\nI prefer lighter head-heavy racquets and have found that the Head Ti S6, with its light weight and large sweet spot, has worked well for me.

As you get more playing time in, you will begin to notice how the racquet behaves and after a while, you will have an idea of what you\u2019re looking for\u2026i.e. more power, more control. Tennis elbow is definitely something you should be aware of. As you begin playing higher rated opponents, you will be up against a faster and heavier ball. This means your arm will get more wear and tear. You may have to dampen your racquet later on. This may not apply to you. Not everyone gets tennis elbow, because not everyone is built the same way.

The assailant, a fan of German tennis star Steffi Graf, apparently hoped that by injuring Seles his idol Graf would be able to regain her No. 1 ranking.\nSeles became the youngest woman to win the French Open in 1990 when she defeated No. 1-ranked Steffi Graff in the finals.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn April 30, 1993, Seles, then 19, was sitting on a courtside seat during a changeover in her match against Magdalena Maleeva at the Hamburg Open when 38-year-old Gunter Parche leaned over a fence and stabbed her between the shoulder blades with a knife. Parche was quickly apprehended by security officials and Seles was taken to the hospital. She recovered from her physical injuries but was left with deep emotional scars and didn\u2019t play again professionally for another two years.\u201d\n\n\u201cParche, who was described as a mentally unbalanced loner, contended he was only trying to hurt Seles, not kill her. A German court convicted him of grievous bodily harm in October 1993 and he received a two-year suspended sentence. Seles, along with many others, was angered by the lenient verdict and prosecutors eventually won the right to a re-trial. However, the judge at Parche\u2019s second trial in 1995 upheld the suspended sentence.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn August 1995, Seles, who became a U.S. citizen the previous year, made her tennis comeback by winning the Canadian Open. The next month, she lost the U.S. Open finals to Steffi Graf. In January 1996, she won her fourth Australian Open and final Grand Slam title.\u00a0In 2003, a foot injury forced Seles out of competition, and she played only sporadically. In February 2008, Seles officially retired.\u201d\n\n[article](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/tennis-star-monica-seles-stabbed)", "replies": ["> A German court convicted him of grievous bodily harm in October 1993 and he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\nThe legal system just makes absolutely no sense to me.", ">A German court convicted him of grievous bodily harm in October 1993 and he received a two-year suspended sentence.\n\nThis honestly blows my mind.

Telegraph Sport understands that line judges will still work the courts during this year\u2019s Championships, dressed in their distinctive blue Ralph Lauren blazers. But as time goes by, the All England Club are likely to come under growing pressure to fall into line with other events.\n\n  \nMost players prefer the clinical nature of the robots to the possibility of human error, however sterile the automated system might feel. And individual mistakes will become more and more controversial as they grow rarer around the tour \u2013 even if Wimbledon still gives players the option to make three Hawk-Eye challenges per set.  \n\n\n  \nIt is not only tradition which informs the All England Club position. The last chairman but one, Philip Brook, was always adamant that the existence of human line-judges helped to maintain the officiating pathway which eventually leads to the umpire\u2019s chair. That remains the club\u2019s viewpoint today.\n\n  \nThis stance was echoed on Friday by a distinguished former chair umpire who spoke to Telegraph Sport. The ATP\u2019s decision would \u201cimprove on-court officiating,\u201d said the official, who preferred not to be named, \u201cat the cost of losing thousands of people who are part of the tennis ecosystem.
